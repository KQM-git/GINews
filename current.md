Reach Adventure Rank 28 and complete the Archon Quest "A New Star Approaches" and the World Quest "Surreptitious Seven-Star Seal Sundering" to unlock the underground mines.

II. New Character

5-Star Character "Pillar of Fortitude" Kamisato Ayato (Hydro)

◇ Vision: Hydro

◇ Weapon: Sword

◇ The young but highly accomplished head of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan. Cultured and polite, he is a man of many ways and means.

Kamisato Ayato's Elemental Skill "Kamisato Art: Kyouka" creates flash-step movements, leaving behind a watery illusion at his original location, and he then enters the Takimeguri Kanka state. After it is formed, the watery illusion will explode if opponents are nearby or after its duration ends, dealing AoE Hydro DMG. In the Takimeguri Kanka state, Ayato will use his Shunsuiken to engage in blindingly fast attacks, causing DMG from his Normal Attacks to be converted to AoE Hydro DMG. This cannot be overridden.

His Elemental Burst "Kamisato Art: Suiyuu"  unveils a garden of purity that silences the cacophony within. While this space exists, Bloomwater Blades will constantly rain down and attack opponents within its AoE, dealing Hydro DMG and increasing the Normal Attack DMG of characters within.

III. New Domain

The Lost Valley

The ancient ritual grounds were buried beneath the earth amidst a cataclysm that tore heaven and earth asunder before being uplifted by the descent of an alien object, and finally unveiled by a destructive battle that resulted from a betrayal. Nonetheless, those who once frequented this place are no more.

◇ Unlock Criteria:

• Reach Adventure Rank 22 or above

• Complete the Archon Quest "Prologue: Act III - Song of the Dragon and Freedom"

• And fulfill certain criteria

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain artifacts in the "Vermillion Hereafter" and "Echoes of an Offering" sets.

Located at The Chasm.

IV. New Equipment

1. New Weapon

Haran Geppaku Futsu (5-Star Sword)

◇ A famed work by the Futsu line of smiths. The name "Haran" comes from the manner in which it resembles the violent, roiling waves.

◆ Obtain All Elemental DMG Bonus. When other nearby party members use Elemental Skills, the character equipping this weapon will gain 1 Wavespike stack. Max 2 stacks. This effect can be triggered once every 0.3s. When the character equipping this weapon uses an Elemental Skill, all stacks of Wavespike will be consumed to gain Rippling Upheaval: each stack of Wavespike consumed will increase Normal Attack DMG by a certain amount for 8s.

2. New Artifact Sets

Vermillion Hereafter (4-Star and 5-Star)

◇ 2-Piece Set: Increased ATK.

◇ 4-Piece Set: After using an Elemental Burst, this character will gain the Nascent Light effect, increasing their ATK by a certain percentage for 16s. When the character's HP decreases, their ATK will further increase by a certain percentage. This further increase can occur this way a maximum of 4 times. This effect can be triggered once every 0.8s. Nascent Light will be dispelled when the character leaves the field. If an Elemental Burst is used again during the duration of Nascent Light, the original Nascent Light will be dispelled.

Echoes of an Offering (4-Star and 5-Star)

◇ 2-Piece Set: Increased ATK.

◇ 4-Piece Set:When Normal Attacks hit opponents, there is a certain chance that it will trigger Valley Rite, which will increase Normal Attack DMG by a certain percentage of ATK. This effect will be dispelled 0.05s after a Normal Attack deals DMG. If a Normal Attack fails to trigger Valley Rite, the odds of it triggering the next time will increase by a certain percentage. This trigger can occur once every 0.2s.

V. New Events

During the event, you will receive quests to help organize the Irodori Festival.

Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

There is an issue in the current version whereby the Electro-Charged reaction mechanism is abnormal. This is a new issue that surfaced after the Version 2.4 update.

The development team has detected the cause of this issue and it will be fixed in the Version 2.7 update.

After the issue is fixed, the Electro-Charged reaction mechanism is expected to function as it did before the Version 2.4 update.

Continuous attacks have a very low probability of abnormally and significantly extending the duration of various effects on the character Kamisato Ayato (up to twice the duration), including but not limited to the "Takimeguri Kanka" state from his Elemental Skill, "Corrosion", and "Smoldering Flames" that are applied to the character.

The developers have detected the initial cause of this issue. As the fix involves fundamental logic, this issue will be fixed in Version 3.0 after comprehensive testing.

*Note: The fix will not affect the abnormal increase in duration caused by hit lag, or Plunging Attacks that can be performed from jumping on a flat surface due to hit lag.

When using an iOS or Android device to play the game, after some characters cast their Elemental Bursts, there may be a problem with their weapons' color display. This issue will be fixed in a later version update. Please stay tuned for future notices.

After updating the official driver released by Razer on January 20, some Travelers using Razer devices on PC may experience a crash error when logging in to the game. Travelers who encounter this problem can try to uninstall the Razer driver first and restart the computer as a temporary fix.
