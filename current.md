# Pre-Installation Function Now Available
## Pre-Installation Function Now Available
![Banner](https://sdk.hoyoverse.com/upload/announcement/2021/02/26/90e4c2152f1c4ab7409c2d474f867e8e_4752326209098996257.jpg)

Dear Travelers,

The pre-installation function is now available on both PC and mobile platforms.

Pre-installation on mobile devices will download some of the new resources in advance, which will speed up download progress at login after the update and save time.

When the version update is released, Travelers on iOS devices must enter the App Store and tap "Update." Android users may open the game and follow the directions on-screen (or open Google Play and tap "Update").

Travelers on mobile platforms will be unable to play the game while pre-installing game resources. It's recommended that Travelers complete any Domains or other challenges they wish to finish first before beginning the pre-installation process.

Travelers on PC can still play the game while pre-installing game resources. Pre-installation will take up a certain amount of your network's bandwidth, so it's best to make sure you have a good network connection before beginning pre-installation.

After pre-installation is complete, Travelers can update the game and experience new version content faster.

**〓How to Update〓**

Mobile (iOS & Android)

Method 1: Travelers may begin pre-installing update resources by going to the Paimon Menu > Settings > Other > Pre-Install Resource Package.

![img](https://sdk.hoyoverse.com/upload/announcement/2021/01/26/68a9fceeba35ae753c1af63b6e643985_6581160582160153510.jpg)

Method 2: Travelers may also begin pre-installing update resources by tapping the "Pre-Install Resource Package" icon in the bottom-left corner of the login screen.

![img](https://sdk.hoyoverse.com/upload/announcement/2021/01/26/713ee4fb32a360d87ca3307282ce51c1_3349484738719370436.jpg)

When the version update is released, Travelers on iOS devices must enter the App Store and tap "Update." Android users may open the game and follow the directions on-screen (or open Google Play and tap "Update").

Using the pre-installation function will reduce the time that the game spends updating resources on the first time you enter a new version, even if you did not fully complete pre-installation.

PC:

After the pre-installation function is available, you must first update the Genshin Impact Launcher. After updating the launcher, a "Game Pre-Installation" button will appear to the left of the "Launch" button. Click "Game Pre-Installation" to download the latest game resources.

![img](https://sdk.hoyoverse.com/upload/announcement/2021/11/15/3aedbcbd2b930621f9ccf9b30ded7c1f_3403275470040386358.png)

Using the pre-installation function can speed up the update progress of the launcher during version updates.

# Version Details - What's New 
## Update Summary
![Banner](https://sdk.hoyoverse.com/upload/announcement/2020/11/11/0c4d0c742dde8334be30352fa3f5fb5b_4067277611421326976.jpg)

Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

There is an issue whereby the Icy Paws fired by Diona's Elemental Skill might not target Wildlife opponents normally. This issue has been fixed in Version 3.1 and the fix will take effect after the version update.

Presently, Dendro Cores produced by Bloom reactions would cause some characters' skill effects to be triggered incorrectly. We are diagnosing the issue and will fix the problem in future updates. Please stay tuned for future notices.

There is an issue under certain circumstances whereby after the character Dori casts her Elemental Skill several times quickly within a short period of time, there is a chance that the number of Elemental Particles generated, and the effect of her Passive Talent "Compound Interest" may be abnormal. This issue will be fixed in the Version 3.1 update.

Presently, while challenging Fayz Trials on certain Android devices, some Travelers will encounter graphic glitches, whereby characters and enemies cannot be seen clearly due to model anomalies. For a temporary solution, Travelers can go to "Settings > Graphics" to adjust the "Render Resolution" to medium or lower settings. If the issue exists still, Travelers may submit feedback through "Paimon Menu > Feedback."

There is an issue under specific circumstances whereby players are unable to send messages in the dialogue window when playing on mobile devices. Travelers who encounter this issue can exit via the Paimon Menu and log back in to the game, or enter and exit an indoor environment (such as the Favonius Cathedral and the Knights of Favonius Headquarters) as a temporary fix. If the issue persists, Travelers can report the issue through the Feedback tab in the Paimon Menu.

There is an issue whereby effects gained based on a character's attribute were incorrectly increased (excluding when an effect confers one attribute as a certain percentage of another attribute). The affected effects include:

Effect of the Weapon "Hunter's Path"

The Dendro Traveler's Passive Talent "Verdant Luxury"

Tighnari's Passive Talent "Scholarly Blade"

This issue will be fixed in the Version 3.1 update.
