## Update Summary

Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

There is an issue after the Version 2.8 update whereby some enemies (such as Geovishap Hatchling) have a small chance of displaying abnormal target tracking when casting their skills. This issue will be fixed in a later update, please stay tuned to our announcements.

Continuous attacks have a very low probability of abnormally and significantly extending the duration of various effects on the character Kamisato Ayato (up to twice the duration), including but not limited to the "Takimeguri Kanka" state from his Elemental Skill, "Corrosion", and "Smoldering Flames" that are applied to the character.

The developers have detected the initial cause of this issue. As the fix involves fundamental logic, this issue will be fixed in Version 3.0 after comprehensive testing.

*Note: The fix will not affect the abnormal increase in duration caused by hit lag, or Plunging Attacks that can be performed from jumping on a flat surface due to hit lag.

When using an iOS or Android device to play the game, after some characters cast their Elemental Bursts, there may be a problem with their weapons' color display. This issue will be fixed in a later version update. Please stay tuned for future notices.

〓Update Content 2022/07/28 16:20:00 (global)〓

Updated resources related to subsequent events.

〓Update Content 2022/07/22 17:55:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue under certain circumstances whereby the Story Quest "The Ancient Azure Stars" cannot be completed, as players are unable to return to the quest location due to being blocked by barriers when carrying out the objective "Solve the astral puzzle."

We will resolve the problem within 36 hours for all accounts that have been affected before the update. After the fix goes live, Travelers can log in again to continue the quest.

Fixes an issue whereby there is a small chance that the connection between the stars would disappear abnormally if you move away from the stars in the Domain then approach them again when carrying out the Story Quest "The Ancient Azure Stars."

〓Update Content 2022/07/21 11:20:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue with the character Shikanoin Heizou's Elemental Skill whereby when you hit opponents under the effect of 4 Declension stacks (i.e. the Conviction effect), the elemental effect produced might be abnormal. After the fix, the elemental effect produced by the Elemental Skill at 4 Declension stacks will be consistent with that of other Declension stacks.

Before making any payments, please check that the UID you are topping up matches your account. (You can check your UID in-game by opening the Paimon Menu.) When topping up a UID, any purchases will be automatically applied to the corresponding game account.

Travelers are advised that there may be a delay between topping up and receiving the items in-game.

If you have any questions about topping up, please send us an email at genshin_payment@hoyoverse.com

To ensure a fair and healthy Genshin Impact gaming environment and offer Travelers a great gaming experience, we would like to remind everyone that the following rules apply to all Travelers at all times:

1) The use of plug-ins, accelerators, and any other third-party tools that affect the fairness of the game is strictly forbidden.

COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. (herein referred to as "we") will respond to any such activity by taking measures including but not limited to removal of inappropriately obtained rewards, suspension of accounts, and permanent banning of accounts, with the precise measures to be decided based on the seriousness and number of violations.

2) The sale, purchase, or transfer of accounts by any means is strictly forbidden.

We urge Travelers to protect their personal property and information, ignore any requests for account sharing or trading, and refrain from purchasing accounts on other platforms. Likewise, Travelers are forbidden from sharing or selling their own account.

In accordance with Genshin Impact's Terms of Service, we will not be responsible for any personal information leaks or damages resulting from a Traveler's own actions.

3) Top-up via non-official channels and third parties is strictly forbidden.

We will respond to any such activity by taking measures including but not limited to removal of inappropriately obtained rewards, suspension of accounts, and permanent banning of accounts, with the precise measures to be decided based on the seriousness and number of violations.

We are committed to guaranteeing the fair gameplay of Genshin Impact and to safeguarding Travelers' in-game assets. As we endeavor to constantly improve Genshin Impact, we wholeheartedly hope that Travelers join us in creating and maintaining a fair and harmonious gaming environment.
