II. New Character

5-Star Character "Pillar of Fortitude" Kamisato Ayato (Hydro)

◇ Vision: Hydro

◇ Weapon: Sword

◇ The young but highly accomplished head of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan. Cultured and polite, he is a man of many ways and means.

Kamisato Ayato's Elemental Skill "Kamisato Art: Kyouka" creates flash-step movements, leaving behind a watery illusion at his original location, and he then enters the Takimeguri Kanka state. After it is formed, the watery illusion will explode if opponents are nearby or after its duration ends, dealing AoE Hydro DMG. In the Takimeguri Kanka state, Ayato will use his Shunsuiken to engage in blindingly fast attacks, causing DMG from his Normal Attacks to be converted to AoE Hydro DMG. This cannot be overridden.

His Elemental Burst "Kamisato Art: Suiyuu"  unveils a garden of purity that silences the cacophony within. While this space exists, Bloomwater Blades will constantly rain down and attack opponents within its AoE, dealing Hydro DMG and increasing the Normal Attack DMG of characters within.

III. New Domain

The Lost Valley

The ancient ritual grounds were buried beneath the earth amidst a cataclysm that tore heaven and earth asunder before being uplifted by the descent of an alien object, and finally unveiled by a destructive battle that resulted from a betrayal. Nonetheless, those who once frequented this place are no more.

◇ Unlock Criteria:

• Reach Adventure Rank 22 or above

• Complete the Archon Quest "Prologue: Act III - Song of the Dragon and Freedom"

◆ Obtain All Elemental DMG Bonus. When other nearby party members use Elemental Skills, the character equipping this weapon will gain 1 Wavespike stack. Max 2 stacks. This effect can be triggered once every 0.3s. When the character equipping this weapon uses an Elemental Skill, all stacks of Wavespike will be consumed to gain Rippling Upheaval: each stack of Wavespike consumed will increase Normal Attack DMG by a certain amount for 8s.

2. New Artifact Sets

Vermillion Hereafter (4-Star and 5-Star)

◇ 2-Piece Set: Increased ATK.

◇ 4-Piece Set: After using an Elemental Burst, this character will gain the Nascent Light effect, increasing their ATK by a certain percentage for 16s. When the character's HP decreases, their ATK will further increase by a certain percentage. This further increase can occur this way a maximum of 4 times. This effect can be triggered once every 0.8s. Nascent Light will be dispelled when the character leaves the field. If an Elemental Burst is used again during the duration of Nascent Light, the original Nascent Light will be dispelled.

Echoes of an Offering (4-Star and 5-Star)

◇ 2-Piece Set: Increased ATK.

◇ 4-Piece Set:When Normal Attacks hit opponents, there is a certain chance that it will trigger Valley Rite, which will increase Normal Attack DMG by a certain percentage of ATK. This effect will be dispelled 0.05s after a Normal Attack deals DMG. If a Normal Attack fails to trigger Valley Rite, the odds of it triggering the next time will increase by a certain percentage. This trigger can occur once every 0.2s.

# Version Details - What's New 
## Update Summary
![Banner](https://uploadstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/announcement/2020/11/11/0c4d0c742dde8334be30352fa3f5fb5b_4067277611421326976.jpg)

Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

There is an issue in the current version whereby the Electro-Charged reaction mechanism is abnormal. This is a new issue that surfaced after the Version 2.4 update.

The development team has detected the cause of this issue and it will be fixed in the Version 2.7 update.

After the issue is fixed, the Electro-Charged reaction mechanism is expected to function as it did before the Version 2.4 update.

Continuous attacks have a very low probability of abnormally and significantly extending the duration of various effects on the character Kamisato Ayato (up to twice the duration), including but not limited to the "Takimeguri Kanka" state from his Elemental Skill, "Corrosion", and "Smoldering Flames" that are applied to the character.

The developers have detected the initial cause of this issue. As the fix involves fundamental logic, this issue will be fixed in Version 3.0 after comprehensive testing.

*Note: The fix will not affect the abnormal increase in duration caused by hit lag, or Plunging Attacks that can be performed from jumping on a flat surface due to hit lag.

There is a localization error in Korean regarding the description of Kamisato Ayato's Elemental Burst in the "Test Run" event. The developers are already working to fix this issue, please stay tuned for future notices regarding the exact time of the fix.

When using an iOS or Android device to play the game, after some characters cast their Elemental Bursts, there may be a problem with their weapons' color display. This issue will be fixed in a later version update. Please stay tuned for future notices.

After updating the official driver released by Razer on January 20, some Travelers using Razer devices on PC may experience a crash error when logging in to the game. Travelers who encounter this problem can try to uninstall the Razer driver first and restart the computer as a temporary fix. If the issue persists, please contact us via the email Genshin_cs@hoyoverse.com.

〓Update Content 2022/04/02 16:10:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue whereby some Teleport Waypoints in the area were not displayed properly on the map when the fog in Tsurumi Island had not been completely removed.

〓Update Content 2022/04/02 14:00:00 (global)〓

Starting on 2022/04/02, we will update the game resources on PC via the launcher through grayscale release in 7 days.

Travelers are requested to launch the game through the launcher to ensure that they receive timely updates.

〓Update Content 2022/04/01 16:10:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue under specific circumstances whereby the objective "Look for clues near the dark fog" in the World Quest "Perils in the Dark" cannot be completed.Travelers who encountered this issue can head to the quest trigger location and exit the game via the Paimon Menu, and then log back into the game so you can continue to progress in the quest.

〓Update Content 2022/03/31 12:00:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue under certain circumstances whereby there is a probability that the background music of some areas cannot be played when playing on iOS devices. Travelers who experience this issue can exit the game via the Paimon Menu, then log back in to resolve the problem.

Fixes an issue under certain circumstances whereby when playing the game on iOS devices, disabling "Motion Blur" in "Settings > Graphics" did not take effect properly.
