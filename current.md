I. Areas

New Areas in Sumeru Now Available

◇ New Areas：In Version 3.1, the areas, Hypostyle Desert, Land of Lower Setekh, and Land of Upper Setekh in the Sumeru region will be available.

New Daily Commissions will be added in Sumeru.

In addition, there will be new Fishing Points and "Radiant Spincrystals" in the new areas released.

II. New Characters

5-Star Character "Judicator of Secrets" Cyno (Electro)

◇ Vision: Electro

◇ Weapon: Polearm

◇ The General Mahamatra in charge of supervising the researchers of the Akademiya. It is said that when he gets down to work, the General Mahamatra is even more efficient than the "Great Vayuvyastra" made by the Kshahrewar.

◆ Elemental Skill "Secret Rite: Chasmic Soulfarer"

◆ Performs a swift thrust, dealing Electro DMG to opponents along the path. When Cyno is under the Pactsworn Pathclearer state triggered by the Elemental Burst "Sacred Rite: Wolf's Swiftness," he will instead unleash a Mortuary Rite that deals thunderous AoE Electro DMG and extends the duration of Pactsworn Pathclearer.

◆ Elemental Burst "Sacred Rite: Wolf's Swiftness"

◆ Calls upon a divine spirit to possess him, morphing into the Pactsworn Pathclearer, causing his Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks to be converted to Electro Damage that cannot be overridden. At the same time, Cyno's Elemental Mastery and resistance to interruption will increase, and he gains immunity to Electro-Charged Damage. This effect will be canceled when Cyno leaves the field and lasts for a set duration.

5-Star Character "Dance of Lotuslight" Nilou (Hydro)

◇ Vision: Hydro

◇ Weapon: Sword

◇ The star of the Zubayr Theater. She is full of warmth and innocence, and her dances are lively and elegant.

◆ Elemental Skill "Dance of Haftkarsvar"

◆ Nilou will enter the Pirouette state, dealing Hydro DMG to nearby opponents based on her Max HP. While she is in the Pirouette state, Nilou's Normal Attacks and Elemental Attacks will cause her to enter the Sword Dance and Whirling Steps stances respectively, causing DMG she deals to be converted to Hydro DMG that cannot be overridden and that is considered Elemental Skill DMG. In these stances, Nilou's third dance step will end Pirouette, and has the following effects:

· Sword Dance: unleashes a Luminous Illusion that deals Hydro DMG to opponents it touches and grants Nilou the Lunar Prayer effect. This effect converts Nilou's Normal Attacks into Sword Dance techniques, and her final hit will unleash a Luminous Illusion.

· Whirling Steps: Nilou unleashes a Whirling Water Wheel that deals AoE Hydro DMG and creates a Tranquility Aura that follows your active character around and applies Wet to opponents within its AoE.

Nilou is unable to perform Charged Attacks when under the effect of Pirouette or Lunar Prayer. These effects will be removed once she leaves the field.

◆ Elemental Burst "Dance of Abzendegi: Distant Dreams, Listening Spring"

◆ Begins the dance of faraway dreams and springs that hear, causing a Lotus of Distant Waters to bloom, dealing AoE Hydro DMG based on Nilou's Max HP and applying the Lingering Aeon effect to all opponents hit. After an interval, opponents affected by Lingering Aeon will take Hydro DMG.

◇ After unlocking Nilou's Passive Talent "Court of Dancing Petals," when all characters in the party are either Dendro or Hydro, and there is at least one Dendro character and one Hydro character:

The completion of the third dance step of Nilou's Dance of Haftkarsvar will grant all nearby characters the Golden Chalice's Bounty for 30s upon its completion. Characters under the effect of Golden Chalice's Bounty will have their Elemental Mastery increased whenever they are hit by Dendro attacks. Also, triggering the Bloom reaction will create Bountiful Cores instead of Dendro Cores. Such Cores will burst very quickly after being created, and they have larger AoEs. Bountiful Cores cannot trigger Hyperbloom or Burgeon, and they share an upper numerical limit with Dendro Cores. Bountiful Core DMG is considered DMG dealt by Dendro Cores produced by Bloom.

4-Star Character "Golden Vow" Candace (Hydro)

◇ Vision: Hydro

◇ Weapon: Polearm

◇ A descendant of King Deshret with an amber left eye. The defender of Aaru Village.

◆ Elemental Skill "Sacred Rite: Heron's Sanctum"

◆ Tap this skill, and Candace rushes forward with her shield, dealing Hydro DMG. Hold and she raises her shield to block incoming attacks from nearby opponents, forming a barrier that absorbs DMG based on her Max HP and absorbs Hydro DMG 250% more effectively. This barrier lasts until the Elemental Skill is unleashed. After holding for a certain period of time, Candace will finish charging, and when the skill button is released, the skill duration expires, or when the barrier is broken, she will perform a leaping strike that deals Hydro DMG to opponents in front of her.

◆ Elemental Burst "Sacred Rite: Wagtail's Tide"

◆ Candace calls upon a divine blessing that deals AoE Hydro DMG based on her Max HP and continuously confers the Prayer of the Crimson Crown on your active character. The Prayer of the Crimson Crown effect has the following properties: Characters deal increased Elemental DMG with their Normal Attacks. Whenever a character takes the field, they will unleash a rippling wave of water that deals Hydro DMG to nearby opponents. Sword, Claymore, and Polearm-wielding character(s) on the field under this effect will obtain a Hydro Infusion.

III. New Domains

Domain: Garden of Endless Pillars

◇ This palatial place was once dominated by many thousands of giant pillars, and priests and the powerful alike once walked beneath their bower unrestrained. But all that is left of the mighty and proud city of sapphire now is wrack and ruin.

◇ Unlock Criteria: Reach Adventure Rank 24 or above and fulfill certain criteria.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems and Dendro Sigils.

Domain: Altar of Mirages

◇ The Jinn once used this place as a free theater and a paradise without sorrow or care. The people of the desert wastes also once used this place as a ritual site to remember the ages long past... But all these joys and sorrows, like a false mirage, would disappear amidst the flow of the Ley Lines.

◇ Unlock Criteria: Reach Adventure Rank 28 or above and fulfill certain criteria.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems and Dendro Sigils.

Domain: Red Desert Threshold

◇ Legend has it that were once a prince who was exiled by his father and imprisoned in this jail. The bronze revelation first emerged here in this lonely, forgotten place where there is neither day nor night.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems and Dendro Sigils.

VI. New Enemies

Aeonblight Drake

◇ This dragon-shaped combat machine is a being that inspires fear, much like the lord who once ruled these vast lands.

This machine has even greater abilities than the Ruin Drake, being able to attack from the air and on the ground. Can periodically release a dangerous torrent of energy during combat and increase its own Elemental RES against the previous main type of Elemental DMG it suffered. Take this opportunity to attack their cores, and you may be able to immobilize this creature...

Located at Ardravi Valley.

Algorithm of Semi-Intransient Matrix of Overseer Network

◇ This ancient aggregation of machinery hails from the desert and has quirks that modern-day civilizations cannot comprehend.

In battle, the Algorithm of Semi-Intransient Matrix of Overseer Network will fire its components out while its core enters an "invisible" state that hides it and increases its RES. Use Catalyze reactions to strike this core, or use Electro attacks on it during such times as the fired components have been destroyed and need to recover to cancel this invisibility.

Located at Hypostyle Desert.

Primal Construct: Prospector, Primal Construct: Reshaper, and Primal Construct: Repulsor

◇ These ancient machines, which come from the desert, are quite distinct from the Ruin Machines.

In combat, these Primal Constructs will fire their components out while their cores enter an "invisible" state that hides them and increases their RES. Use Catalyze reactions to strike these cores or use Electro attacks on them during such times as the fired components have been destroyed and need to recover to cancel this invisibility.

Eremite Stone Enchanter and Eremite Galehunter

◇ Warriors that may be found in one of the many scattered mercenary groups that hail from the desert.

They will unleash the ominous spirit contained within their body to fight alongside them after taking a certain amount of damage. This will cause them to enter an Infused Form. Defeat these spirits and they will enter a weakened state for a fixed amount of time thereafter.

In addition, the Floating Anemo Fungus, Whirling Pyro Fungus, Stretchy Electro Fungus, and Grounded Geoshroom will be added.

Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

There is an issue in Co-Op Mode whereby when multiple Cyno characters cast their Elemental Burst, the display of Endseer's special effect might be displayed abnormally (the actual effects of the skill work as intended in-game). This issue will be fixed in a later update, please stay tuned for future notices.

There is an issue whereby there is a brief period of abnormal brightness changes in the game when some characters enter Aiming Mode or after casting their Elemental Burst. This issue will be fixed in a later update, please stay tuned for future notices.

Currently, there is an issue of abnormal color display in some features (such as meteorites summoned by the Geo Traveler's Elemental Skill, Paimon's cloak, Elemental Sight, etc.) in areas affected by "The Withering." This issue will be fixed in a future version.

〓Update Content 2022/10/13 16:25:00 (global)〓

Fixes an error in Russian whereby the text for the Dendro Traveler's Passive Talent "Surgent Manifestation" is displayed abnormally.

Updates resources related to subsequent events.

〓Update Content 2022/09/30 20:50:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue under certain circumstances whereby there is a small probability that the Everlight Cell and Neverlight Cell at one location of the Khaj-Nisut in Land of Lower Setekh would be abnormal, resulting in a failure to open the corresponding door. Travelers who encounter this issue can continue to solve the puzzle mechanism after logging in again.

〓Update Content 2022/09/30 14:25:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue under certain conditions whereby Travelers could not open the corresponding treasure chest after arriving at the location indicated by the 13th landscape painting in the Mysterious Clipboard of the gadget "Aranyaka." Travelers who encounter this issue can log out through the Paimon Menu and log in again to resolve it.

Fixes an issue whereby when carrying out the quest objective "Pass the three trials" in the World Quest "Golden Slumber: Dreams Beneath the Searing Sand," the quest could not continue as the Neverlight Cells would have a small probability of being abnormal, resulting in a failure to open the door. Travelers who encounter this issue can continue to solve the puzzle mechanism after logging in again.

Fixes an issue with a treasure chest near Dar al-Shifa in the Land of Lower Setekh area whereby after defeating the nearby enemy, if the player does not open the chest before the end of the day, they will be unable to unlock the chest the following day.

〓Update Content 2022/09/29 16:05:00 (global)〓

To ensure a fair and healthy Genshin Impact gaming environment and offer Travelers a great gaming experience, we would like to remind everyone that the following rules apply to all Travelers at all times:

2) The sale, purchase, or transfer of accounts by any means is strictly forbidden.

We urge Travelers to protect their personal property and information, ignore any requests for account sharing or trading, and refrain from purchasing accounts on other platforms. Likewise, Travelers are forbidden from sharing or selling their own account.

In accordance with Genshin Impact's Terms of Service, we will not be responsible for any personal information leaks or damages resulting from a Traveler's own actions.
