# Pre-Installation Function Now Available
## Pre-Installation Function Now Available
![Banner](https://sdk.hoyoverse.com/upload/announcement/2021/02/26/90e4c2152f1c4ab7409c2d474f867e8e_4752326209098996257.jpg)

Dear Travelers,

The pre-installation function is now available on both PC and mobile platforms.

Pre-installation on mobile devices will download some of the new resources in advance, which will speed up download progress at login after the update and save time.

When the version update is released, Travelers on iOS devices must enter the App Store and tap "Update." Android users may open the game and follow the directions on-screen (or open Google Play and tap "Update").

Travelers on mobile platforms will be unable to play the game while pre-installing game resources. It's recommended that Travelers complete any Domains or other challenges they wish to finish first before beginning the pre-installation process.

Travelers on PC can still play the game while pre-installing game resources. Pre-installation will take up a certain amount of your network's bandwidth, so it's best to make sure you have a good network connection before beginning pre-installation.

After pre-installation is complete, Travelers can update the game and experience new version content faster.

**〓How to Update〓**

Mobile (iOS & Android)

Method 1: Travelers may begin pre-installing update resources by going to the Paimon Menu > Settings > Other > Pre-Install Resource Package.

![img](https://sdk.hoyoverse.com/upload/announcement/2021/01/26/68a9fceeba35ae753c1af63b6e643985_6581160582160153510.jpg)

Method 2: Travelers may also begin pre-installing update resources by tapping the "Pre-Install Resource Package" icon in the bottom-left corner of the login screen.

![img](https://sdk.hoyoverse.com/upload/announcement/2021/01/26/713ee4fb32a360d87ca3307282ce51c1_3349484738719370436.jpg)

When the version update is released, Travelers on iOS devices must enter the App Store and tap "Update." Android users may open the game and follow the directions on-screen (or open Google Play and tap "Update").

Using the pre-installation function will reduce the time that the game spends updating resources on the first time you enter a new version, even if you did not fully complete pre-installation.

PC:

After the pre-installation function is available, you must first update the Genshin Impact Launcher. After updating the launcher, a "Game Pre-Installation" button will appear to the left of the "Launch" button. Click "Game Pre-Installation" to download the latest game resources.

Using the pre-installation function can speed up the update progress of the launcher during version updates.

# Version Details - What's New 
## Update Summary
![Banner](https://sdk.hoyoverse.com/upload/announcement/2020/11/11/0c4d0c742dde8334be30352fa3f5fb5b_4067277611421326976.jpg)

Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

There is an issue whereby the Icy Paws fired by Diona's Elemental Skill might not target Wildlife opponents normally. This issue has been fixed in Version 3.1 and the fix will take effect after the version update.

Presently, Dendro Cores produced by Bloom reactions would cause some characters' skill effects to be triggered incorrectly. We are diagnosing the issue and will fix the problem in future updates. Please stay tuned for future notices.

There is an issue under certain circumstances whereby after the character Dori casts her Elemental Skill several times quickly within a short period of time, there is a chance that the number of Elemental Particles generated, and the effect of her Passive Talent "Compound Interest" may be abnormal. This issue will be fixed in the Version 3.1 update.

Presently, while challenging Fayz Trials on certain Android devices, some Travelers will encounter graphic glitches, whereby characters and enemies cannot be seen clearly due to model anomalies. For a temporary solution, Travelers can go to "Settings > Graphics" to adjust the "Render Resolution" to medium or lower settings. If the issue exists still, Travelers may submit feedback through "Paimon Menu > Feedback."

There is an issue under specific circumstances whereby players are unable to send messages in the dialogue window when playing on mobile devices. Travelers who encounter this issue can exit via the Paimon Menu and log back in to the game, or enter and exit an indoor environment (such as the Favonius Cathedral and the Knights of Favonius Headquarters) as a temporary fix. If the issue persists, Travelers can report the issue through the Feedback tab in the Paimon Menu.

There is an issue whereby effects gained based on a character's attribute were incorrectly increased (excluding when an effect confers one attribute as a certain percentage of another attribute). The affected effects include:

Effect of the Weapon "Hunter's Path"

The Dendro Traveler's Passive Talent "Verdant Luxury"

Tighnari's Passive Talent "Scholarly Blade"

This issue will be fixed in the Version 3.1 update.

There is an issue whereby the Voice-Over Unlock Criteria for Collei's line "About Fischl" in Profile > Voice-Over is abnormal. This issue will be fixed in the Version 3.1 update. The Unlock Criteria after the fix will be "Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 4."

Currently, there is an issue of abnormal color display in some features (such as meteorites summoned by the Geo Traveler's Elemental Skill, Paimon's cloak, Elemental Sight, etc.) in areas affected by "The Withering." This issue will be fixed in a future version.

〓Update Content2022/09/15 16:10:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue under specific circumstances whereby characters could not move and abnormalities occurred in certain viewing angles of the characters.

〓Update Content2022/09/08 16:30:00 (global)〓

II. New Characters

5-Star Character "Verdant Strider" Tighnari (Dendro)

◇ Vision: Dendro

◇ Weapon: Bow

◇ A young researcher well-versed in botany who currently serves as a Forest Watcher in Avidya Forest. He is a straight shooter with a warm heart — and a dab hand at guiding even the dullest of pupils.

◆ Tighnari has a special Charge Level 2 Aimed Shot and can be charged to fire a Wreath Arrow, dealing Dendro DMG. It also generates 4 homing Clusterbloom Arrows after hitting, dealing further Dendro DMG.

◆ Elemental Skill: Vijnana-Phala Mine

◆ Throws a Vijnana Stormheart ahead that deals AoE Dendro DMG, creating a Vijnana-Khanda Field that creates mysterious illusions that taunt opponents and draw their fire. Additionally, Tighnari gains the Vijnana Suffusion effect, which will decrease the Wreath Arrow's charging time. This effect will dissipate once the skill duration ends or after Tighnari has fired 3 Wreath Arrows.

◆ Elemental Burst: Fashioner's Tanglevine Shaft

◆ Fires 6 Tanglevine Shafts that can track opponents and deal Dendro DMG. After they hit, the Tanglevine Shafts will create a secondary wave of Tanglevine Shafts that can also track opponents and deal Dendro DMG on hit.

◆ The 5-star character "Verdant Strider" Tighnari (Dendro) will be available in the standard wish "Wanderlust Invocation" in the next Version.

4-Star Character "Sprout of Rebirth" Collei (Dendro)

◆ Elemental Skill: Floral Brush

◆ Throws out a Floral Ring that deals 1 instance of Dendro DMG to targets it comes into contact with.

◆ Elemental Burst: Trump-Card Kitty

◆ Throws the doll named Cuilein-Anbar, causing an explosion that deals AoE Dendro DMG, creating a Cuilein-Anbar Zone. Cuilein-Anbar will bounce around within this zone, dealing AoE Dendro DMG.

◇ Vision: Electro

◇ Weapon: Claymore

◇ An elusive merchant who has a fondness for glittering Mora.

◆ Elemental Skill: Spirit-Warding Lamp: Troubleshooter Cannon

◆ Directs a Spirit-Warding Lamp to fire off a Troubleshooter Shot at opponents, dealing Electro DMG. After the Troubleshooter Shot hits, it will create 2 After-Sales Service Rounds that will automatically track opponents and deal Electro DMG.

◆ Elemental Burst: Alcazarzaray's Exactitude

◆ Summons forth the Jinni within the lamp, that connects to a nearby character. The connected character will continuously restore HP based on Dori's Max HP, and will continuously regenerate Energy. When the connector between the Jinni and the character touches opponents, it will deal Electro DMG to them every 0.4s. Only one Lamp Spirit can exist at one time.

5-Star Character Traveler (Dendro)

◇ Interact with a Statue of The Seven - Dendro to resonate with the Dendro element, and use a new Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst.

◆ Elemental Skill: Razorgrass Blade

◆ Deals Dendro DMG ahead.

◆ Elemental Burst: Surgent Manifestation

◆ Calls upon the might of the flora all around you, creating a Lea Lotus Lamp. This Lamp will deal continuous Dendro DMG to opponents within its AoE. The Lea Lotus Lamp will undergo corresponding changes after it comes into contact with Hydro/Electro/Pyro.

III. New Domains

Domain of Forgery: Tower of Abject Pride

◇ It is said that the deserts were once home to three sage-kings, one of whom remained lovely and wise till the very end. They parted ways eventually for the sake of the paradise they sought in their hearts. This place is called a "tower," but in truth was the temporary residence of one of these people when they were building that earthly paradise. If one stretches the past back even further, it was once a small shrine built to avoid the wind and the sand.

◇ Unlock Criteria:

• Reach Adventure Rank 22 or above

• Or complete the Archon Quest Prologue: Act II "For a Tomorrow Without Tears"

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain Weapon Ascension Materials.

Domain of Mastery: Steeple of Ignorance

◇ In the ancient past, man-made towers that could touch the skies were built all across the land. Though human hearts flowed downward, their souls aspired toward the high heavens. These towers would always fall, or collapse under their own weight and plummet into the depths. However, if one were to look at things at a grander scale, the heavens and earth are as one — no direction is truly different from another.

◇ Unlock Criteria:

• Reach Adventure Rank 22 or above

• Or complete the Archon Quest Chapter I: Act I "Of the Land Amidst Monoliths"

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain Talent Level-Up Materials.

Domain of Blessing: Spire of Solitary Enlightenment

◇ In ancient times, this was a great and beautiful place, seemingly made to bless the children of humanity. But the arrow of heaven would descend, making mountains out of flat land and burying the ancient capitol beneath the hills.

◇ Unlock Criteria:

• Reach Adventure Rank 22 or above

• Or complete the Archon Quest "Prologue: Act III - Song of the Dragon and Freedom"

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain artifacts in the "Deepwood Memories" and "Gilded Dreams" sets.

Domain: Under the Umbrella's Shade

◇ The poets have it that spores, like trees, are connected to each other, and that all fungal beings in the world share a single dream. At the end of that dream, the spores would take on the forms of all things, and that all things would return to the beginning — return to being one — and that there would never again be boundaries. But the evolution of Fungi into sentient, locomotive beings was not something that happened in such primordial times. Regardless, this place has become fertile soil for Fungi to thrive.

◇ Unlock Criteria: Reach Adventure Rank 20 or above and fulfill certain criteria.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems, Dendro Sigils, and more.

Domain: Fragment of Childhood Dreams

◇ This was once a dreamland paradise of a child of the forest, constructed based on how other children would describe the woods. In their memories, the forest was incredibly vast, much like the world itself. The forest was also immensely deep, just like fate itself. Although the dimensions of the world and the true depth of destiny would ultimately disappoint, the fantasy of them endures deep within this nursery.

◇ Unlock Criteria: Reach Adventure Rank 24 or above and fulfill certain criteria.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems, Dendro Sigils, and more.

Domain: The Dark Valley

◇ Legend has it that the moon once had a face. Under the fierce moon's face, like a white bow, the paths through the forest labyrinth would bring lost people to jade and amber dreams. This forest labyrinth has ceased to exist for hundreds of years — and yet even a hundred thousand winters must seem like a day in the garden of dreams.

◇ Unlock Criteria: Reach Adventure Rank 28 or above and fulfill certain criteria.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems, Dendro Sigils, and more.

Domain: The Coordinates of Sun and Rain

◇ According to the legends, the goddess who had command over plants would summon forth a spirit of timely rains, whose name was Varuna, or "water and sky." These same legends say that the now-deceased forest king used hedges and streams, and the children of the pomegranate used dreams and illusions to create a labyrinth as deep and intricate as the very roots of trees themselves, to defend the secret of sun and rain.

◇ Unlock Criteria: Reach Adventure Rank 32 or above and fulfill certain criteria.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems, Dendro Sigils, and more.

◆ During the event wish "Epitome Invocation," the event-exclusive 5-star weapon Hunter's Path (Bow) will receive a huge drop-rate boost!

King's Squire (4-Star Bow)

Obtain the Teachings of the Forest effect when unleashing Elemental Skills and Bursts, increasing Elemental Mastery by 60 for 12s. This effect will be removed when switching characters.

ATK is increased by a certain percentage for each party member whose Elemental Type is the same as the equipping character, and Elemental Mastery is increased by a certain value for every party member with a different Elemental Type. Each of the aforementioned buffs will count up to 3 characters. This effect can be triggered once every few seconds. The character who equips this can still trigger its effects when not on the field.

V. Elemental Reactions

1. Catalyze

When creatures are affected by Electro and Dendro, the Quicken reaction will occur, which will render them Quickened.

When a Quickened entity is attacked by Electro or Dendro, they will trigger Aggravate and Spread respectively, which will increase DMG taken.

2. Bloom

When creatures are affected by Hydro and Dendro, the Bloom reaction will occur, generating a Dendro Core.

Only a certain number of Dendro Cores can exist at the same time. If new ones are created once this limit is reached, or if the duration of the existing Dendro Cores ends, the pre-existing Dendro Cores will explode, dealing AoE Dendro DMG.

When Dendro Cores come into contact with Pyro, they will trigger Burgeon, causing even greater AoE Dendro DMG. When Dendro Cores come into contact with Electro, they will trigger Hyperbloom, and transform into homing Sprawling Shots.
