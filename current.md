〓Update Details〓

I. New Gameplay

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Genius Invokation TCG is a tightly-paced, heart-stopping tabletop card dueling game.

Join as a "Genius Invokation TCG" player, collect cards, build your deck, and go toe-to-toe with various opponents at the table!

◇ Unlock Criteria:

• Reach Adventure Rank 32 or above

• Complete the Archon Quest "Song of the Dragon and Freedom"

◇ System Rules:

1. Find challengers in the open world or enter the tavern to play matches against weekly visiting challengers, and earn Player EXP, and Lucky Coins.

2. Player EXP can be used to increase your Player Level, which in turn unlocks new functions and more challengers. Lucky Coins can be used to purchase Genius Invokation cards and used to purchase Match Invitation Letters and various items related to Genius Invokation TCG.

3. You can use the invitation board to send invitations to registered challengers on the Player List and partake in duel matches. Should you prevail in these matches, you can also earn corresponding Character and Talent Cards.

4. You can use the invitation board and connect with your friends via Co-Op to partake in a Genius Invokation TCG match. After reaching a certain Player Level, you can also match with faraway strangers to duels of skill.

*After Genius Invokation TCG is officially launched, we will continue to adjust and optimize the balance of cards based on the duel situation and feedback of Travelers, so as to continuously improve the gameplay experience of Genius Invokation TCG.

The Genius Invokation TCG balance adjustment in the Version 3.3 update is as follows:

Adjusts Elemental Burst damage dealt by the Character Card "Maguu Kenki" in Genius Invokation TCG: "Deals 6 Anemo DMG..." is now adjusted to "Deals 4 Anemo DMG...".

II. New Characters

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ Vision: Anemo

◇ Weapon: Catalyst

◇ A wayfaring figure whose identity is a mystery. He dresses like a mountain ascetic, but he certainly does not act the part.

◆ Elemental Skill "Hanega: Song of the Wind"

◆ Deals AoE Anemo DMG before leaping into the air and entering the Windfavored state. In this state, the Wanderer is unable to use Plunging Attacks, and his Normal and Charged Attacks are converted to Kuugo: Fushoudan and Kuugo: Toufukai. The DMG they deal and their AoE will be increased, and their DMG will be considered Normal and Charged Attack DMG respectively. The Wanderer will hover persistently during this time. Consume Kuugoryoku Points to maintain this hovering state, move and sprint mid-air, and increase hovering height. Running out of Kuugoryoku Points or casting the Elemental Skill again while in this state will end the Windfavored state.

◆ Elemental Burst "Kyougen: Five Ceremonial Plays"

◆ Deals multiple instances of AoE Anemo DMG. If the character is in the Windfavored state due to the skill "Hanega: Song of the Wind," Windfavored state will end after casting.

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ Vision: Anemo

◇ Weapon: Bow

◇ A researcher from "one hundred years ago." She enjoys self-identifying as everyone's senior, and has significant knowledge of ancient scripts and machines of all kinds.

◆ Elemental Skill "Wind Realm of Nasamjnin"

◆ Deploys a polyhedron that deals AoE Anemo DMG to nearby opponents. She will also enter the Manifest Gale state. While in the Manifest Gale state, Faruzan's next fully charged shot will consume this state and will become a Hurricane Arrow that contains high-pressure currents. This arrow deals Anemo DMG based on the DMG of a fully charged Aimed Shot from "Normal Attack: Parthian Shot." The Hurricane Arrow will apply a Pressurized Collapse effect to the opponent or character hit. This effect will be removed after a short delay, creating a vortex that deals AoE Anemo DMG and pulls nearby objects and opponents in. If the Hurricane Arrow does not hit any opponent or character, it will create a Pressurized Collapse effect at its point of impact.

◆ Elemental Burst "The Wind's Secret Ways"

◆ Deploys a Dazzling Polyhedron that unleashes a Whirlwind Pulse and deals AoE Anemo DMG. While the Dazzling Polyhedron persists, it will continuously move along a triangular path. Once it reaches each corner of that triangular path, it will unleash 1 more Whirlwind Pulse. When the Whirlwind Pulse is unleashed, it will apply Perfidious Wind's Bale to nearby opponents, decreasing their Anemo RES. The Whirlwind Pulse will also apply Prayerful Wind's Benefit to all nearby party members when it is unleashed, granting them an Anemo DMG Bonus.

III. New Domain

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ This stronghold, once protected by seven mighty battlements, crumbled overnight when King Deshret fell and an age of chaos ensued. Where gold-eyed warriors once stood guard over watchtowers of gilded luster, now, only a desiccated temple built upon sundered rocks remains, more akin to a tomb for an age of radiance long lost.

◇ Unlock Criteria:

• Reach Adventure Rank 22 or above

• Or complete the Archon Quest "Prologue: Act III - Song of the Dragon and Freedom"

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain artifacts in the "Desert Pavilion Chronicle" and "Flower of Paradise Lost" sets.

IV. New Equipment

1. New Weapons

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Normal Attack SPD is increased by 10%. After the wielder unleashes an Elemental Skill, Normal Attack DMG will increase by 4.8% every second for 14s. After this character hits an opponent with a Normal Attack during this duration, Normal Attack DMG will be increased by 9.6%. This increase can be triggered once every 0.3s. The maximum Normal Attack DMG increase per single duration of the overall effect is 48%. The effect will be removed when the wielder leaves the field, and using the Elemental Skill again will reset all DMG buffs.

◆ During the event wish "Epitome Invocation," the event-exclusive 5-star weapon Tulaytullah's Remembrance (Catalyst) will receive a huge drop-rate boost!

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">After an attack hits opponents, it will inflict an instance of Cursed Parasol upon one of them for 10s. This effect can be triggered once every 15s. If this opponent is taken out during Cursed Parasol's duration, Cursed Parasol's CD will be refreshed immediately. The character wielding this weapon will deal 16% more DMG to the opponent affected by Cursed Parasol.

◆ Toukabou Shigure (Sword) and its refinement materials can be redeemed in the event "Akitsu Kimodameshi."

2. New Artifacts

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ 2-Piece Set: Increased Anemo DMG Bonus.

◇ 4-Piece Set: When Charged Attacks hit opponents, the equipping character's Normal Attack SPD will increase by 10% while Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attack DMG will increase by 40% for 15s.

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ 2-Piece Set: Increased Elemental Mastery.

◇4-Piece Set: The equipping character's Bloom, Hyperbloom, and Burgeon reaction DMG are increased by 40%. Additionally, after the equipping character triggers Bloom, Hyperbloom, or Burgeon, they will gain another 25% bonus to the effect mentioned prior. Each stack of this lasts 10s. Max 4 stacks simultaneously. This effect can only be triggered once per second. The character who equips this can still trigger its effects when not on the field.

V. New Main Story

1. New Archon Quest

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◆ Quest Unlock Criteria

• Reach Adventure Rank 40 or above

• Complete Archon Quest Chapter III: Act V "Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises"

• Complete Kaedehara Kazuha's Story Quest: Acer Palmatum Chapter - Act I "A Strange and Friendless Road"

This effect can be triggered once every 1s. Max 6 stacks. It will be removed when the character leaves the field or deals a different type of Elemental or Physical DMG.

Phase II:

We urge Travelers to protect their personal property and information, ignore any requests for account sharing or trading, and refrain from purchasing accounts on other platforms. Likewise, Travelers are forbidden from sharing or selling their own account.

In accordance with Genshin Impact's Terms of Service, we will not be responsible for any personal information leaks or damages resulting from a Traveler's own actions.
