〓Update Details〓

I. New Characters

5-Star Character "Valley Orchid" Yelan (Hydro)

◇ Vision: Hydro

◇ Weapon: Bow

◇ Yelan's Elemental Skill "Lingering Lifeline" fires off a Lifeline that pulls her in rapidly, entangling and marking opponents along its path. When her rapid movement ends, the Lifeline will explode, dealing Hydro DMG to the marked opponents based on Yelan's Max HP. Additionally, each opponent marked by the Lifeline when it explodes grants Yelan a chance to obtain Breakthrough. This will cause her next Charged Aimed Shot to have a decreased charge time, and once charged, she can fire a "Breakthrough Barb" that will deal AoE Hydro DMG based on Yelan's Max HP.

Her Elemental Burst "Depth-Clarion Dice" deals AoE Hydro DMG once and creates an "Exquisite Throw," which aids her in battle. This follows the character around and will initiate a coordinated attack under the following circumstances, dealing Hydro DMG based on Yelan's Max HP. This can occur once every second when your active character uses a Normal Attack and will occur each time Yelan's Lifeline explodes and hits opponents.

◇ A mysterious person who claims to work for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, but is a "non-entity" on the Ministry of Civil Affairs' list.

4-Star Character "Mender of Tribulations" Kuki Shinobu (Electro)

◇ Vision: Electro

◇ Weapon: Sword

◇ Kuki Shinobu's Elemental Skill "Sanctifying Ring" creates a Grass Ring of Sanctification at the cost of part of her HP, dealing Electro DMG to nearby opponents. Grass Ring of Sanctification follows the current active character around. It deals Electro DMG to nearby opponents periodically and restores HP for the active character(s) within the ring's AoE based on Kuki Shinobu's Max HP. The HP consumption from using this skill can only bring her to 20% HP.

Her Elemental Burst "Gyoei Narukami Kariyama Rite" stabs an evil-excoriating blade into the ground, creating a field that cleanses the area of all that is foul, dealing continuous Electro DMG to opponents within its AoE based on Shinobu's Max HP. If Shinobu's HP is less than or equal to 50% when this skill is used, the field will last longer.

◇ The capable and reliable deputy leader of the "Arataki Gang" - Please note: capable and reliable are not appellations for the "Arataki Gang," but for their deputy leader in specific.

II. New Equipment

Aqua Simulacra (Bow)

Increases HP. When there are opponents near the character equipping this weapon, the DMG the character deals is increased. This effect will still be detected when the character is off-field.

◇ This longbow's color is unpredictable. Under the light, it takes on a lustrous, watery blue.

Fading Twilight (Bow)

This weapon will come with 1 of 3 buffs. Each of the 3 buffs will increase the DMG dealt by the character by different percentages. When the character hits an opponent, the buff will change to the next effect type. This can be triggered once every 7s, and can be triggered even if the character is off-field.

◇A precious bow made of platinum, inlaid with an orb that shimmers with the light of eventide.

III. New Events

During the event, go to The Chasm and investigate the mysteries of the depths. Complete various challenges in the event to obtain rewards like Primogems, Crown of Insight, Weapon Ascension Materials, Talent Level-Up Materials, Mystic Enhancement Ore, Hero's Wit, and Mora. Complete specific "Realms of Guile and War" to obtain the event-exclusive weapon "Fading Twilight" (Bow) and its Refinement Material.

New Furnishing: Leisure Device: Confused Confuzzlement

A furnishing combination made with great care by Tubby, this set comprises a Seeker's Board and many Confuzzled Tubbers. After interacting with the Seeker's Board, you can begin a treasure hunt or view hunt records. The Confuzzled Tubbers can be freely placed within a set space, where they will continuously remain. You can combine these placements with pre-existing furnishings within the Serenitea Pot to hide the Tubbers, after which you will have to search for these Tubbers within a time limit.

After hearing about Mondstadt's traditional game, Windtrace, from the Traveler, Tubby also resolved to create a game based around hide-and-seek, thus creating this particular furnishing combination. However, such a game that only involved Tubby, the Traveler, and Paimon would have too few people and thus lack a certain fun factor. As such, Tubby created many "Confuzzled Tubber" toys to play the role of other participants. Tubby even suggested that the Traveler could use adeptal energies to create playing fields and invite friends to come and experience the fun together.

Added "Challenge Features" descriptions to Domains of Blessing, Forgery, and Mastery with a high Recommended Party Level.

The gadget "Floral Zither" can now be purchased from the NPC Granny Shan in Liyue Harbor.

Added Sets 7–14 of Genshin Impact "Paimon's Paintings" chat emojis.

Added Character level-up guides: Travelers can check Characters' Talent recommendations and Artifact Main Attribute references.

Spiral Abyss

Floor 11 Ley Line Disorder changed to:

• DMG dealt by claymore-wielding characters increased by 75%.

Updated the monster lineup on Floors 11 – 12 of the Spiral Abyss.

Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 2.7, the three Lunar Phases will be as follows:

Phase I:

Closing Moon

After the active character uses an Elemental Skill, >Normal Attack DMG is increased by 16% for 8s. Max 3 stacks. Stacks are counted independently.

Phase II:

Matched Moon

After a character's Elemental Skill hits an opponent, that opponent's Physical and All Elemental RES will be decreased by 12% for 8s. Max 3 stacks. Stacks are counted independently.

Phase III:

Steelsunder Moon

After the active character uses an Elemental Skill, that character's next Normal Attack that hits an opponent will unleash a shockwave at that opponent's position, dealing DMG. This effect can occur once every 1.2s.

# Version Details - What's New 
## Update Summary
![Banner](https://uploadstatic-sea.hoyoverse.com/announcement/2020/11/11/0c4d0c742dde8334be30352fa3f5fb5b_4067277611421326976.jpg)

Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

Continuous attacks have a very low probability of abnormally and significantly extending the duration of various effects on the character Kamisato Ayato (up to twice the duration), including but not limited to the "Takimeguri Kanka" state from his Elemental Skill, "Corrosion", and "Smoldering Flames" that are applied to the character.

The developers have detected the initial cause of this issue. As the fix involves fundamental logic, this issue will be fixed in Version 3.0 after comprehensive testing.

*Note: The fix will not affect the abnormal increase in duration caused by hit lag, or Plunging Attacks that can be performed from jumping on a flat surface due to hit lag.

When using an iOS or Android device to play the game, after some characters cast their Elemental Bursts, there may be a problem with their weapons' color display. This issue will be fixed in a later version update. Please stay tuned for future notices.

There is an issue whereby the quest item "Archaic Stone" from the Story Quest "No Mere Stone" would disappear abnormally after completing the World Quest "The Tales Behind the Fan." The disappearance of this item will not affect the progress and completion of any relevant quest, and Travelers can continue the quest as normal. This issue will be fixed in the Version 2.8 update and the missing item will be restored after the fix.

〓Update Content 2022/06/09 16:30:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue whereby some interfaces were displayed abnormally.

〓Update Content 2022/06/09 11:45:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue whereby after the Version 2.7 update, the Wolf Within special effects of Razor's idle animation and Elemental Burst would display abnormally (actual combat effects are not affected). After the fix, the effect performance will be the same as before the Version 2.7 update.

Fixes an issue whereby there is a localization error in Korean for the cutscene animation in the Archon Quest "At Tunnel's End, Light."

〓Update Content 2022/06/03 16:10:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue with the Story Quest "Candidature Analysis" whereby there is a small chance that some Places of Interest disappeared when carrying out the quest objective "Investigate the abandoned camp," causing the quest objective to be unable to be completed.

Fixes an issue whereby when there are emails in some languages (such as Thai) in the Mailbox, even if the number of the emails have not reached the limit, the message "Some mail is not displayed" may appear on the mail opening interface, and some emails in the Gift Mail Box will not be displayed normally. Travelers who encounter this problem do not need to delete their in-game mail; other than Gift Mail Box, other mail functions can still be used normally.

〓Update Content 2022/06/03 10:35:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue whereby the "Abyssal Moon Spire - Summary" and "Challenge Summary" pages in the game would freeze when playing on a PC with the system regional format set to Arabic, or on a PS5™ or PS4™ console with the system language set to Arabic.

〓Update Content 2022/06/01 14:40:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue with the Archon Quest "Danger All Around" whereby Travelers may not be able to control their characters if they reconnect to the server during a conversation when carrying out the quest objective "Examine the mysterious door in front of you."

Travelers who encounter this issue can enter the Domain again to continue the quest.

〓Update Content 2022/06/01 02:00:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue whereby the "Events Overview" and "Mail" pages would display abnormally or freeze when playing on a PC with the system regional format set to Arabic, or on a PS5™ or PS4™ console with the system language set to Arabic.

Travelers affected by these issues can restart the game to continue playing normally.
