# Pre-Installation Function Now Available
## Pre-Installation Function Now Available
![Banner](https://uploadstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/announcement/2021/02/26/90e4c2152f1c4ab7409c2d474f867e8e_4752326209098996257.jpg)

Dear Travelers,

The pre-installation function is now available on both PC and mobile platforms.

Pre-installation on mobile devices will download some of the new resources in advance, which will speed up download progress at login after the update and save time.

When the version update is released, Travelers on iOS devices must enter the App Store and tap "Update." Android users may open the game and follow the directions on-screen (or open Google Play and tap "Update").

Travelers on mobile platforms will be unable to play the game while pre-installing game resources. It's recommended that Travelers complete any Domains or other challenges they wish to finish first before beginning the pre-installation process.

Travelers on PC can still play the game while pre-installing game resources. Pre-installation will take up a certain amount of your network's bandwidth, so it's best to make sure you have a good network connection before beginning pre-installation.

After pre-installation is complete, Travelers can update the game and experience new version content faster.

**〓How to Update〓**

Mobile (iOS & Android)

Method 1: Travelers may begin pre-installing update resources by going to the Paimon Menu > Settings > Other > Pre-Install Resource Package.

![img](https://uploadstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/announcement/2021/01/26/68a9fceeba35ae753c1af63b6e643985_6581160582160153510.jpg)

Method 2: Travelers may also begin pre-installing update resources by tapping the "Pre-Install Resource Package" icon in the bottom-left corner of the login screen.

![img](https://uploadstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/announcement/2021/01/26/713ee4fb32a360d87ca3307282ce51c1_3349484738719370436.jpg)

When the version update is released, Travelers on iOS devices must enter the App Store and tap "Update." Android users may open the game and follow the directions on-screen (or open Google Play and tap "Update").

Using the pre-installation function will reduce the time that the game spends updating resources on the first time you enter a new version, even if you did not fully complete pre-installation.

PC:

After the pre-installation function is available, you must first update the Genshin Impact Launcher. After updating the launcher, a "Game Pre-Installation" button will appear to the left of the "Launch" button. Click "Game Pre-Installation" to download the latest game resources.

![img](https://uploadstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/announcement/2021/11/15/3aedbcbd2b930621f9ccf9b30ded7c1f_3403275470040386358.png)

Using the pre-installation function can speed up the update progress of the launcher during version updates.

〓Update Details〓

I. New Characters

5-Star Character "Lonesome Transcendence" Shenhe (Cryo)

◇ Vision: Cryo

◇ Weapon: Polearm

◇ An adepti disciple with a most unusual air about her. Having spent much time cultivating in isolation in Liyue's mountains, she has become every bit as cool and distant as the adepti themselves.

◆ Shenhe's Elemental Skill, "Spring Spirit Summoning," can produce different effects based on how it is used: when pressed, she will rush forward and deal Cryo DMG, whereas when held, she will deal AoE Cryo DMG in front of her. These two different usage methods will provide teammates with Icy Quill effects that will be triggered for a different number of times based on the usage method. Icy Quill increases Cryo DMG dealt by characters' Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks, Elemental Skills, and Elemental Bursts based on Shenhe's own ATK.

Her Elemental Burst, "Divine Maiden's Deliverance," deals sustained AoE Cryo DMG to opponents in the field, and also decreases the Cryo RES and Physical RES of opponents in the field.

4-Star Character "Stage Lucida" Yun Jin (Geo)

◇ Vision: Geo

◇ Weapon: Polearm

◇ A renowned Liyue opera singer who is skilled in both playwriting and singing. Her style is one-of-a-kind, exquisite and delicate, much like the person herself.

◆ When Yun Jin uses her Elemental Skill, "Opening Flourish," she charges upward, forming a shield. After the skill button is released, when its duration ends, or when the shield breaks, it will deal Geo DMG. DMG dealt is based on Yun Jin's DEF, and Shield DMG Absorption is based on Yun Jin's Max HP.

Her Elemental Burst "Cliffbreaker's Banner," deals a one-time AoE Geo DMG to nearby opponents and grants all nearby party members a "Flying Cloud Flag Formation" which will increase DMG dealt by Normal Attacks. The increase will be based on Yun Jin's own DEF. Flying Cloud Flag Formation will disappear when the number of times is used up or at the end of the duration.

◆ During the event wish "The Transcendent One Returns," the event-exclusive 5-star character "Lonesome Transcendence" Shenhe (Cryo) and 4-star character "Stage Lucida" Yun Jin (Geo) will get a huge drop-rate boost!

II. New Area

Floor 11 Ley Line Disorders changed to:

• All party members' Normal Attack DMG increased by 50%.

Floor 12 Ley Line Disorders changed to:

• Certain opponents in this challenge possess the Honed Spirit effect, which grants them 10% Physical and All Elemental RES.

The RES lost this way will be reset every 20s.

Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 2.4, the three Lunar Phases will be as follows：

Phase I:

Blade-Flourish Moon

When the active character's Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attacks hit opponents multiple times within 2s, that character's Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attack DMG is increased by 5% for 8s. Max 15 stacks. This effect can be triggered once every 0.1s and will be cleared if the character goes down or leaves the field.

Phase II:

Blooming Moon

When the active character hits opponents with attacks that are considered Normal Attack DMG, there is a 50% chance of unleashing a shockwave at the hit opponent's position, dealing AoE True DMG. One shockwave can be released in this way every 0.3s.

Phase III:

Awakening Moon

When the active character's Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attacks hit opponents multiple times within 2s, the character gains a stack of Emergence for 8s. This effect can be triggered once every 0.1s. Emergence will be cleared when the character goes down or leaves the field. When the character gains 15 Emergence stacks, the stacks will be cleared and a shockwave will be unleashed that deals True DMG to nearby opponents. After a shockwave is unleashed in this way, all party members will deal 25% increased DMG for 10s.

Other Adjustments:

To ensure a fair and healthy Genshin Impact gaming environment and offer Travelers a great gaming experience, we would like to remind everyone that the following rules apply to all Travelers at all times:

1) The use of plug-ins, accelerators, and any other third-party tools that affect the fairness of the game is strictly forbidden.

2) The sale, purchase, or transfer of accounts by any means is strictly forbidden.

We urge Travelers to protect their personal property and information, ignore any requests for account sharing or trading, and refrain from purchasing accounts on other platforms. Likewise, Travelers are forbidden from sharing or selling their own account.

In accordance with miHoYo's Terms of Service, we will not be responsible for any personal information leaks or damages resulting from a Traveler's own actions.

We will respond to any such activity by taking measures including but not limited to removal of inappropriately obtained rewards, suspension of accounts, and permanent banning of accounts, with the precise measures to be decided based on the seriousness and number of violations.
