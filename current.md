〓Update Details〓

I. New Area

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ The desert's border stretches on. Legend has it that between the countless scimitar-shaped ravines that cut across the desert plain, a lost city of old lies hidden with a wandering tribe seeking refuge in its ruins.

Perhaps among the incessant sandstorms that seem to erode all things encompassed by history, a story lost in time awaits to be uncovered...

◇ New Area：In Version 3.4, the area, Desert of Hadramaveth in the Sumeru region will be available.

New Daily Commissions in the Desert of Hadramaveth have been added. In addition, there will be new Fishing Points and "Radiant Spincrystals" in this new area.

II. New Characters

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ Vision: Dendro

◇ Weapon: Sword

◇ The current scribe of the Sumeru Akademiya, a man endowed with extraordinary intelligence and talent. He lives free — free from the searching eyes of ordinary people, anyway.

◆ Elemental Skill "Universality: An Elaboration on Form"

◆ Using his Elemental Skill "Universality: An Elaboration on Form," Alhaitham rushes forward. Holding the skill enters Aiming Mode to adjust the direction of Alhaitham's rush attack, dealing Dendro DMG to nearby opponents when the rush ends, causing a Chisel-Light Mirror to form. When he possesses Chisel-Light Mirrors, Alhaitham's Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks will be converted to Dendro DMG that cannot be overridden. When attacks of the aforementioned kinds hit opponents, the Chisel-Light Mirrors will unleash a Projection Attack that deals AoE Dendro DMG based on the number of Mirrors on the field. The Chisel-Light Mirrors will disappear one after the other over time, and will all disappear when Alhaitham leaves the field.

◆ Elemental Burst "Particular Field: Fetters of Phenomena"

◆ Using his Elemental Burst "Particular Field: Fetters of Phenomena," Alhaitham creates a Particular Binding Field and deals multiple instances of AoE Dendro DMG. If Chisel-Light Mirrors exist when this ability is unleashed, all such Mirrors will be consumed and increase the number of DMG instances dealt. 2s after this ability is unleashed, if 0/1/2/3 Mirrors were consumed, Alhaitham will generate 3/2/1/0 new Mirrors in turn.

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ Vision: Dendro

◇ Weapon: Polearm

◇ Streetward Rambler's youngest disciple. A gentle and caring "little adult."

◆ Elemental Skill "Raphanus Sky Cluster"

◆ Using her Elemental Skill "Raphanus Sky Cluster," Yaoyao calls upon "Yuegui: Throwing Mode." Yuegui: Throwing Mode" throws out White Jade Radishes that will explode upon hitting characters or opponents, dealing Dendro DMG to opponents within a certain AoE, and healing characters within that same AoE based on Yaoyao's Max HP. If a radish does not hit either an opponent or a character, the radish will remain where it is and explode on contact with a character or opponent, or will explode after its duration expires.

◆ Elemental Burst "Moonjade Descent"

◆ Using her Elemental Burst "Moonjade Descent," Yaoyao summons "Yuegui: Jumping Mode" at intervals until their limit has been reached. White Jade Radishes generated by Yuegui: Jumping Mode will heal all nearby party members, and the Dendro DMG that they deal will be viewed as Elemental Burst DMG. The Adeptal Legacy state will also increase Yaoyao's SPD and Dendro RES. The Adeptal Legacy state will end once Yaoyao is off-field, and all remaining Yuegui: Jumping Mode will be cleared once this state ends.

III. New Domains

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ The significance of oases lies in the embrace of the desert. The oasis dwellers have never been oblivious to this. Thus did the ancestors in Gurabad build the hermitage for the Lord of Desert. Through the sandstorm-shrouded past and present, this hermitage has become an asylum for countless desert dwellers, among whom are some bandits as well...

◇ Unlock Criteria:

• Reach Adventure Rank 28 or above and fulfill certain criteria.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems and Dendro Sigils.

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ The then-lords of Gurabad regarded death as the only path to the desert's sacred destination. In order to prevent the wretched from defiling this pilgrimage, they buried the unnamed tomb deep underground... But now, this place has become nothing but a paradise for Wenut and Fungi.

◇ Unlock Criteria:

• Reach Adventure Rank 32 or above and fulfill certain criteria.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems and Dendro Sigils.

IV. New Equipment

New Weapon

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">CRIT Rate is increased by 4%. After Normal Attacks deal Elemental DMG, the Foliar Incision effect will be obtained, increasing DMG dealt by Normal Attacks and Elemental Skills by 120% of Elemental Mastery. This effect will disappear after 28 DMG instances or 12s. You can obtain Foliar Incision once every 12s.

◆ During the event wish "Epitome Invocation," the event-exclusive 5-star weapon Light of Foliar Incision (Sword) will receive a huge drop-rate boost!

V. New Outfits

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ Ayaka's travel outfit. Its design is based on the Fontaine dresses depicted in light novel illustrations and seems to reflect the lifestyle of proper ladies who live in that nation.

◆ After the Version 3.4 update – 2023/02/27 03:59:59 (server), during this period, Kamisato Ayaka's outfit "Springbloom Missive" will be available for purchase in the Character Outfit Shop at a limited-time discount. During the discount period, the price of the outfit is 1,350 Genesis Crystals. The price will revert to 1,680 Genesis Crystals after the limited-time discount ends. The outfit can only be purchased once.

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ An outfit Lisa had someone commission for her when she revisited Sumeru. A perfect balance between practicality and elegance, the dress bears a resemblance to Lisa's old uniform from the Akademiya days.

◆ During Version 3.4, Travelers can obtain Lisa's outfit "A Sobriquet Under Shade" for free by participating in the limited-time "Second Blooming" event.

◆ After Version 3.4 is over, Travelers can buy the outfit in the Character Outfit Shop.

VI. New Main Story

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Alhaitham's Story Quest - Vultur Volans Chapter: Act I "The Illusions of the Mob"

Permanently available after the Version 3.4 update

◆ Quest Unlock Criteria

• Reach Adventure Rank 40 or above

• Complete Archon Quest Chapter III: Act V "Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises"

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◆ New World Quests: "The Dirge of Bilqis," "Her Foes Rage Like Great Waters...," "Tadhla the Falcon," "Apocalypse Lost," "Rejoice With Me, for What Was Lost Is Now Found" and more.

*After fulfilling certain criteria, the World Quest "Her Foes Rage Like Great Waters..." will be available on 2023/02/06 04:00:00 (server).

VII. New Enemies

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ An eyeless predator that dwells within the depths of the desert and uses sound and vibrations to seek out its prey.

It can use the power of Anemo to a certain extent, which allows it to leave the ground when in combat and enter a floating state. While floating, it can fire Windbite Bullets. Attacks from elements that may react with Anemo can destroy Windbite Bullets, which will temporarily decrease the corresponding Elemental RES of the Setekh Wenut. After 2 Windbite Bullets are destroyed in succession, the Setekh Wenut will be brought down from its floating state.

Located at Desert of Hadramaveth

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ Lifeforms that became twisted and warped by eating some great being.

During combat, they will enter the powerful Phagocytic form. Some of their attacks will unleash Phagocytic Energy Blocks. Use the corresponding elemental attacks to destroy these Energy Blocks to absorb the power within them, which can then be unleashed when attacking the Consecrated Beasts, dealing significant DMG and paralyzing the creatures temporarily.

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ Warriors that may be found in one of the many scattered mercenary groups that hail from the desert.

They will unleash the ominous spirit contained within their body to fight alongside them after taking a certain amount of damage. This will cause them to enter an Infused Form. Defeat these spirits and they will enter a weakened state for a fixed amount of time thereafter.

To ensure a fair and healthy Genshin Impact gaming environment and offer Travelers a great gaming experience, we would like to remind everyone that the following rules apply to all Travelers at all times:

1) The use of plug-ins, accelerators, and any other third-party tools that affect the fairness of the game is strictly forbidden.

COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. (herein referred to as "we") will respond to any such activity by taking measures including but not limited to removal of inappropriately obtained rewards, suspension of accounts, and permanent banning of accounts, with the precise measures to be decided based on the seriousness and number of violations.

2) The sale, purchase, or transfer of accounts by any means is strictly forbidden.

We urge Travelers to protect their personal property and information, ignore any requests for account sharing or trading, and refrain from purchasing accounts on other platforms. Likewise, Travelers are forbidden from sharing or selling their own account.

In accordance with Genshin Impact's Terms of Service, we will not be responsible for any personal information leaks or damages resulting from a Traveler's own actions.

3) Top-up via non-official channels and third parties is strictly forbidden.

We will respond to any such activity by taking measures including but not limited to removal of inappropriately obtained rewards, suspension of accounts, and permanent banning of accounts, with the precise measures to be decided based on the seriousness and number of violations.

We are committed to guaranteeing the fair gameplay of Genshin Impact and to safeguarding Travelers' in-game assets. As we endeavor to constantly improve Genshin Impact, we wholeheartedly hope that Travelers join us in creating and maintaining a fair and harmonious gaming environment.
