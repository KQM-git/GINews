〓Update Details〓

I. New Characters

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ Vision: Pyro

◇ Weapon: Claymore

◇ A member of the Eremites, a mercenary organization that roams the sands of Sumeru. Valiant and powerful, she enjoys great fame amongst her fellow Eremites.

◆ Elemental Skill: Molten Inferno

◆ Dehya's Elemental Skill "Molten Inferno" has two parts to it. "Molten Inferno: Indomitable Flame" deals AoE Pyro DMG and creates a Fiery Sanctum field, while "Molten Inferno: Ranging Flame" recreates said field at a new position after dealing AoE Pyro DMG, which will inherit the remaining duration of the previous field. When an enemy within a Fiery Sanctum field takes damage, the field will unleash a coordinated attack. In addition, active characters within the Fiery Sanctum field have their resistance to interruption increased, and when such characters take DMG, a portion of that damage will be mitigated and flow into Redmane's Blood. Dehya will then take this DMG over a period of time.

◆ Elemental Burst: Leonine Bite

◆ After casting her Elemental Burst "Leonine Bite," Dehya retrieves the Fiery Sanctum on the field and enters the "Blazing Lioness" state, which increases her resistance to interruption. In this state, Dehya uses her Flame-Mane's Fist and Incineration Drive to deal Pyro DMG to enemies. When this state ends, a Fiery Sanctum field will be recreated at her new position, and will inherit the remaining duration of the previous field.

● The 5-star character "Flame-Mane" Dehya (Pyro) will be available in the standard wish "Wanderlust Invocation" in the next Version.

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ Vision: Cryo

◇ Weapon: Polearm

◇ A young knight born to an ordinary family. He serves as a Front-Line Surveyor in his Company. He is a low-key and cautious character.

◆ Elemental Skill: Starfrost Swirl

◆ After using his Elemental Skill "Starfrost Swirl," Mika uses his crossbow to attack, granting all nearby characters in your party Soulwind. When characters in the Soulwind state are on the field, their ATK SPD will be increased. When tapped, Mika fires a Flowfrost Arrow that can pierce through opponents, dealing Cryo DMG to enemies it comes into contact with. When held, Mika goes into Aiming Mode, locking on to an opponent and firing a Rimestar Flare at them, dealing Cryo DMG. When the Rimestar Flare hits, it will rise before exploding, launching Rimestar Shards into a maximum of 3 other opponents, dealing Cryo DMG.

◆ Elemental Burst: Skyfeather Song

◆ After using his Elemental Burst "Skyfeather Song," Mika derives the ability to spur his teammates on from the recited prayers of the knightly order, regenerating HP for all nearby party members. This healing is based on Mika's Max HP and will grant them the Eagleplume state. When the Normal Attacks of active characters affected by Eagleplume hit an opponent, Mika will help them regenerate HP based on his Max HP. Characters affected by this state can only regenerate HP in this way once per short interval of time.

II. New Equipment

New Weapons

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">After the character's Elemental Skill hits an opponent, their ATK will be increased by 20% for 8s. After the character takes DMG, their ATK will be increased by 20% for 8s. The 2 aforementioned effects can be triggered even when the character is not on the field. Additionally, when not protected by a shield, the character's Max HP will be increased by 32%.

◆ During the event wish "Epitome Invocation," the event-exclusive 5-star weapon Beacon of the Reed Sea (Claymore) will receive a huge drop-rate boost!

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Within 8s after the character's Elemental Skill hits an opponent or the character triggers an Elemental Reaction, their ATK and Elemental Mastery will be increased by 12% and 48 respectively.

◆ Mailed Flower (Claymore) and its refinement materials can be redeemed in the event "Windblume's Breath."

III. New Main Story

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Archon Quest Chapter III: Act VI "Caribert"

Permanently available after the Version 3.5 update

◆ Quest Unlock Criteria

• Reach Adventure Rank 35 or above

• Complete Archon Quest Chapter III: Act V "Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises"

◆ Quest Unlock Criteria

• Reach Adventure Rank 40 or above

• Complete Archon Quest Chapter III: Act V "Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises"

IV. New Enemies

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ An Abyss Order monster that uses a dark power to command ice and frost in battle.

Some of its attacks decrease the Stamina of characters while dealing DMG against them.

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ This seems to have once been a trusted guard of high standing in some land who wielded the power of Geo.

Its attacks become stronger and fiercer when they hit shielded characters, at the cost of its own health.

To ensure a fair and healthy Genshin Impact gaming environment and offer Travelers a great gaming experience, we would like to remind everyone that the following rules apply to all Travelers at all times:

1) The use of plug-ins, accelerators, and any other third-party tools that affect the fairness of the game is strictly forbidden.

COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. (herein referred to as "we") will respond to any such activity by taking measures including but not limited to removal of inappropriately obtained rewards, suspension of accounts, and permanent banning of accounts, with the precise measures to be decided based on the seriousness and number of violations.

2) The sale, purchase, or transfer of accounts by any means is strictly forbidden.

We urge Travelers to protect their personal property and information, ignore any requests for account sharing or trading, and refrain from purchasing accounts on other platforms. Likewise, Travelers are forbidden from sharing or selling their own account.

In accordance with Genshin Impact's Terms of Service, we will not be responsible for any personal information leaks or damages resulting from a Traveler's own actions.

We will respond to any such activity by taking measures including but not limited to removal of inappropriately obtained rewards, suspension of accounts, and permanent banning of accounts, with the precise measures to be decided based on the seriousness and number of violations.

We are committed to guaranteeing the fair gameplay of Genshin Impact and to safeguarding Travelers' in-game assets. As we endeavor to constantly improve Genshin Impact, we wholeheartedly hope that Travelers join us in creating and maintaining a fair and harmonious gaming environment.
