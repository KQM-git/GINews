〓Update Details〓

I. New Characters

5-Star Character "Physic of Purity" Nahida (Dendro)

◇ Gnosis: Dendro

◇ Weapon: Catalyst

◇ A caged bird secluded within the confines of the Sanctuary of Surasthana who can only see the world in her dreams.

◆ Elemental Skill "All Schemes to Know"

◆ When tapped, Nahida sends forth karmic bonds of wood and tree from her side, dealing AoE Dendro DMG and marking opponents hit with the Seed of Skandha. When held, she enters Aiming Mode, which will allow you to select a limited number of opponents within a limited area. When Aiming Mode ends, this skill deals Dendro DMG to these opponents and marks them with the Seed of Skandha. Opponents who have been marked by the Seed of Skandha will be linked to one another up till a certain distance. After you trigger Elemental Reactions on opponents who are marked or when they take DMG from Dendro Cores (including Burgeon and Hyperbloom DMG), Nahida will unleash Tri-Karma Purification on this opponent and all connected opponents, dealing Dendro DMG based on her ATK and Elemental Mastery.

◆ Elemental Burst "Illusory Heart"

◆ Materializes the Court of Dreams and brings forth the Shrine of Maya. The Shrine provides different effects depending on the Elemental Types of characters in the party, as follows:

• Pyro: While Nahida remains within the Shrine of Maya, the DMG dealt by Tri-Karma Purification from "All Schemes to Know" is increased.

• Electro: While Nahida remains within the Shrine of Maya, the interval between each Tri-Karma Purification from "All Schemes to Know" is decreased.

• Hydro: The Shrine of Maya's duration is increased.

If there are at least 2 party members of the aforementioned Elemental Types present when the field is deployed, the aforementioned effects will be increased further. Even if Nahida is not on the field, these bonuses will still take effect so long as party members are within the Shrine of Maya.

4-Star Character "Fantastical Evening Star" Layla (Cryo)

◇ Vision: Cryo

◇ Weapon: Sword

◇ A Rtawahist student who specializes in Theoretical Astrology. Heavily prone to somnambulism and locked in a grinding war with sleep deprivation, the problem of restful slumber is a most troubling one to her.

◆ Elemental Skill "Nights of Formal Focus"

◆ Puts forth a shield known as the Curtain of Slumber, dealing AoE Cryo DMG. The Curtain of Slumber's DMG Absorption is based on Layla's Max HP and absorbs Cryo DMG with 250% effectiveness. While the Curtain of Slumber is active, it will create 1 Night Star that will be attached to it every 1.5s. When a character protected by this shield uses an Elemental Skill, 2 Night Stars will be created. Night Stars can be created once every 0.3s in this way. A maximum of 4 Night Stars can be accumulated at any one time. Once 4 Night Stars have been accumulated and there are opponents nearby, these Night Stars will transform into homing Shooting Stars that will be fired off in sequence, dealing Cryo DMG to any opponents hit. If the Curtain of Slumber's duration ends or it is destroyed, the Night Stars will disappear. If they are already being fired off as Shooting Stars, these Shooting Stars will last until this wave of shots ends. New Night Stars cannot be created until the previous wave of Shooting Stars has been fired completely.

◆ Elemental Burst "Dream of the Star-Stream Shaker"

◆ Unleashes a Celestial Dreamsphere that constantly fires Starlight Slugs at opponents within its AoE, dealing Cryo DMG. When a Starlight Slug hits, it will generate 1 Night Star for nearby Curtains of Slumber. Each Curtain of Slumber can gain 1 Night Star this way every 0.5s.

II. New System

New Serenitea Pot System: "Replication"

In the Serenitea Pot, Travelers can generate Replicas to record the Furnishings arrangement of the corresponding area in your realm via the Replication System. Each Replica has a corresponding Replica ID. By using a shared Replica ID, other Travelers can replicate the arrangement of the corresponding Furnishings in their own Realm. If the Replica ID used contains indoor Furnishings, you can reproduce the arrangement of these Furnishings in the same mansion.

Note: To use the Replica ID, you need to unlock the corresponding Realm Layout area and have the required Furnishings. The owner of the Replica ID can choose to enable or disable the Replica sharing function at any time.

If your friend enables sharing of their Replica, you can go to their Serenitea Pot and generate a Replica to record their Realm.

◇ Unlock Criteria:

• Unlock the Serenitea Pot System and complete the World Quest "A Teapot to Call Home: Part II" to unlock the Replication System

III. New Equipment

A Thousand Floating Dreams (5-Star Catalyst)

Party members other than the equipping character will provide the equipping character with buffs based on whether their Elemental Type is the same as the latter or not.

• If their Elemental Types are the same, increase Elemental Mastery by 32.

• If not, increase the equipping character's DMG Bonus from their Elemental Type by 10%.

Each of the aforementioned effects can have up to 3 stacks. Additionally, all nearby party members other than the equipping character will have their Elemental Mastery increased by 40. Multiple such effects from multiple such weapons can stack.

◆ During the event wish "Epitome Invocation," the event-exclusive 5-star weapon A Thousand Floating Dreams (Catalyst) will receive a huge drop-rate boost!

IV. New Main Story

1. New Archon Quest

Archon Quest Chapter III: Act V "Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises"

New Boss

This boss' attacks will create Energy Blocks. Pick these blocks up to recharge the Neo Akasha Terminal. Once it has energy, the Neo Akasha Terminal can be put to various uses.

Dendro Hypostasis

◇ A hypostasis that uses an inert shell to defend itself. It now displays abnormalities due to having been corrupted by some unknown influence.

When it is in danger, it will release Restorative Piths that have the properties of Tri-Lakshana Creatures. Use Dendro to revive these Piths and induce a Normal State in them to continuously cleanse the Dendro Hypostasis, and use Electro to trigger their Activated state and speed up the cleansing process.

Located at Land of Lower Setekh

Spiral Abyss

• All party members have their Elemental Mastery increased by 200.

Updated the monster lineup on Floor 11 of the Spiral Abyss.

Updated the monster lineup on Floor 12 of the Spiral Abyss.

Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 3.2, the two Lunar Phases will be as follows:

Phase I:

Hailing Moon

When characters deal DMG to an opponent, a shockwave will be unleashed at that opponent's position, dealing True DMG. Each Elemental DMG Type (including Physical DMG) can unleash a shockwave this way every 8s.

Phase II:

Lush Moon

When characters trigger Burning, Quicken, Aggravate, Spread, Bloom, Hyperbloom, or Burgeon on an opponent, all party members will gain 10% Dendro DMG Bonus for 10s. This bonus can be triggered once every 5s. Max 4 stacks. Once 4 stacks have been gained, when characters deal Dendro DMG to an opponent, a shockwave will be unleashed at that opponent's position, dealing True DMG. A shockwave can be unleashed in this way once every 5s.

※ The above Spiral Abyss update will take effect from November 16 at 04:00 (Server Time).

To ensure a fair and healthy Genshin Impact gaming environment and offer Travelers a great gaming experience, we would like to remind everyone that the following rules apply to all Travelers at all times:

1) The use of plug-ins, accelerators, and any other third-party tools that affect the fairness of the game is strictly forbidden.

2) The sale, purchase, or transfer of accounts by any means is strictly forbidden.

We urge Travelers to protect their personal property and information, ignore any requests for account sharing or trading, and refrain from purchasing accounts on other platforms. Likewise, Travelers are forbidden from sharing or selling their own account.

In accordance with Genshin Impact's Terms of Service, we will not be responsible for any personal information leaks or damages resulting from a Traveler's own actions.
