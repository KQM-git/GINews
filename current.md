〓Update Details〓

I. New Characters

5-Star Character "Lonesome Transcendence" Shenhe (Cryo)

◇ Vision: Cryo

◇ Weapon: Polearm

◇ An adepti disciple with a most unusual air about her. Having spent much time cultivating in isolation in Liyue's mountains, she has become every bit as cool and distant as the adepti themselves.

◆ Shenhe's Elemental Skill, "Spring Spirit Summoning," can produce different effects based on how it is used: when pressed, she will rush forward and deal Cryo DMG, whereas when held, she will deal AoE Cryo DMG in front of her. These two different usage methods will provide teammates with Icy Quill effects that will be triggered for a different number of times based on the usage method. Icy Quill increases Cryo DMG dealt by characters' Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks, Elemental Skills, and Elemental Bursts based on Shenhe's own ATK.

Her Elemental Burst, "Divine Maiden's Deliverance," deals sustained AoE Cryo DMG to opponents in the field, and also decreases the Cryo RES and Physical RES of opponents in the field.

4-Star Character "Stage Lucida" Yun Jin (Geo)

◇ Vision: Geo

◇ Weapon: Polearm

◇ A renowned Liyue opera singer who is skilled in both playwriting and singing. Her style is one-of-a-kind, exquisite and delicate, much like the person herself.

◆ When Yun Jin uses her Elemental Skill, "Opening Flourish," she charges upward, forming a shield. After the skill button is released, when its duration ends, or when the shield breaks, it will deal Geo DMG. DMG dealt is based on Yun Jin's DEF, and Shield DMG Absorption is based on Yun Jin's Max HP.

Her Elemental Burst "Cliffbreaker's Banner," deals a one-time AoE Geo DMG to nearby opponents and grants all nearby party members a "Flying Cloud Flag Formation" which will increase DMG dealt by Normal Attacks. The increase will be based on Yun Jin's own DEF. Flying Cloud Flag Formation will disappear when the number of times is used up or at the end of the duration.

◆ During the event wish "The Transcendent One Returns," the event-exclusive 5-star character "Lonesome Transcendence" Shenhe (Cryo) and 4-star character "Stage Lucida" Yun Jin (Geo) will get a huge drop-rate boost!

II. New Area

Spiral Abyss

Updated the monster lineup on Floors 11 – 12 of the Spiral Abyss.

Floor 11 Ley Line Disorders changed to:

• All party members' Normal Attack DMG increased by 50%.

Floor 12 Ley Line Disorders changed to:

• Certain opponents in this challenge possess the Honed Spirit effect, which grants them 10% Physical and All Elemental RES. When opponents with Honed Spirit take hits from attacks that are considered Normal Attack DMG, they will lose 3% Physical and All Elemental RES. A maximum of 30% of each may be lost this way. The RES lost this way will be reset every 20s.

Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 2.4, the three Lunar Phases will be as follows：

Phase I:

Blade-Flourish Moon

When the active character's Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attacks hit opponents multiple times within 2s, that character's Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attack DMG is increased by 5% for 8s. Max 15 stacks. This effect can be triggered once every 0.1s and will be cleared if the character goes down or leaves the field.

Phase II:

Blooming Moon

When the active character hits opponents with attacks that are considered Normal Attack DMG, there is a 50% chance of unleashing a shockwave at the hit opponent's position, dealing AoE True DMG. One shockwave can be released in this way every 0.3s.

Phase III:

Awakening Moon

When the active character's Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attacks hit opponents multiple times within 2s, the character gains a stack of Emergence for 8s. This effect can be triggered once every 0.1s. Emergence will be cleared when the character goes down or leaves the field. When the character gains 15 Emergence stacks, the stacks will be cleared and a shockwave will be unleashed that deals True DMG to nearby opponents. After a shockwave is unleashed in this way, all party members will deal 25% increased DMG for 10s.

Other Adjustments:

(a). Adjusts the height of the central stage disc in all levels on Floors 9 – 12 of the Spiral Abyss.

(b). You can view enemy details on the Party Setup page while continuing your way through the Spiral Abyss.

(c). When challenging the Spiral Abyss, if there is an Abyssal Star that has not been obtained, the hint text on the left will be grayed out..

Adjusts animations when some polearm-wielding characters take hits, to reduce interspersed movements.

Adjusts the animation of some claymore-wielding characters when holding their weapons.

Enemies will no longer be regarded as targets when they are defeated and thus will not block attacks from bows or some catalysts.

In Mona's Story Quest, "Astrolabos Chapter," the English voice actor for the NPC Huai'an is changed to David Goldstein.

● Others

(b). If you purchase Gnostic Chorus on PC or mobile only, you will not be able to claim the rewards for this season's Battle Pass via "PlayStation Network" and vice versa: if you purchase it on "PlayStation Store" only, you will not be able to claim rewards on mobile or PC.

(c). If you purchase Gnostic Hymn on PC or mobile, then upgrade it to Gnostic Chorus on the "PlayStation Store," you can claim the rewards for this season's Battle Pass on "PlayStation Network," PC, or mobile. Likewise, if you purchase Gnostic Hymn on the "PlayStation Store," then upgrade it to Gnostic Chorus on PC or mobile, you can claim rewards on "PlayStation Network," PC, or mobile.

After being redirected to the corresponding Domain from the Source section of Weapon Ascension Materials or Talent Level-Up Materials, the Domain for said materials will automatically be selected after entering.

Optimizes the UI style of some buttons and interfaces.

Adds synchronized lip movement for Japanese, Korean, and English voice-over for "Hangout Events: Series I."

Due to the addition of new World Quests, the position of some enemy camps and scene objects near the Teleport Waypoint near Liyue's Lisha area have been adjusted.

Reduces the combat difficulty of the World Quest "Fang of Watatsumi": decreases the total time required to defend the Ley Line Monolith.

Optimizes button control experience of the controller when holding down a button to skip.

To ensure a fair and healthy Genshin Impact gaming environment and offer Travelers a great gaming experience, we would like to remind everyone that the following rules apply to all Travelers at all times:

1) The use of plug-ins, accelerators, and any other third-party tools that affect the fairness of the game is strictly forbidden.

miHoYo (herein referred to as "we") will respond to any such activity by taking measures including but not limited to removal of inappropriately obtained rewards, suspension of accounts, and permanent banning of accounts, with the precise measures to be decided based on the seriousness and number of violations.

2) The sale, purchase, or transfer of accounts by any means is strictly forbidden.

We urge Travelers to protect their personal property and information, ignore any requests for account sharing or trading, and refrain from purchasing accounts on other platforms. Likewise, Travelers are forbidden from sharing or selling their own account.

In accordance with miHoYo's Terms of Service, we will not be responsible for any personal information leaks or damages resulting from a Traveler's own actions.

[miHoYo's Terms of Service](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/company/terms)

3) Top-up via non-official channels and third parties is strictly forbidden.

We will respond to any such activity by taking measures including but not limited to removal of inappropriately obtained rewards, suspension of accounts, and permanent banning of accounts, with the precise measures to be decided based on the seriousness and number of violations.

We are committed to guaranteeing the fair gameplay of Genshin Impact and to safeguarding Travelers' in-game assets. As we endeavor to constantly improve Genshin Impact, we wholeheartedly hope that Travelers join us in creating and maintaining a fair and harmonious gaming environment.

miHoYo reserves the right to final interpretation of these rules.
