〓Event Details〓

● During the event period, you can take part in two gameplay modes: "Fruit Supplement Survey" and "Companion Caper Chronicles."

● In "Fruit Supplement Survey," you must direct Paimon to plan fruit-harvesting routes and pick fruit to complete objectives. Each of the first 3 days will also see 2 "Fruit Supplement Survey" stages unlocked.

● In "Companion Caper Chronicles," you will go on an adventurous journey. You must select corresponding Companion Pieces to form teams that you will then enhance to challenge ever-more-powerful opponents. New "Companion Caper Chronicles" stages will unlock on the 1st and 4th days of the event.

● Complete various challenges to obtain Speculative Records. These can be used to increase your Speculation Level, which can grant you buffs in the "Companion Caper Chronicles" event.

● Reach a certain amount of Speculative Records to invite "Wisdom's Measure" Sethos (Electro), and to receive Primogems, Crown of Insight, and other rewards.
