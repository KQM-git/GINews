| Interactive Map Update: Adds the new areas in Fontaine and categorizes the difficulty of obtaining important collectibles.

As the Fortress of Meropide, the new region in Fontaine, becomes available, the related scenes and pins have also been added on the Map.

Additionally, the difficulty of obtaining important collectibles such as Chests and Oculi has been categorized so that Travelers can be aware of the difficulty of exploration and prepare accordingly.
