**〓Event Details〓**

● For 5 days after the start of the event, a new challenge will become available each day.

● Each challenge will have four rounds of battle. Before the first round of every challenge, you can select four characters to form a team, and before each following challenge round, you can select two characters to join the team.

● Every character starts with 2 Resolve. Each time a character takes part in a combat round, they will lose 1 Resolve. Characters who run out of Resolve cannot continue to be deployed.

● Each challenge will have a unique type of "Roiling Resolve": Special effects will be obtained based on the total Resolve of the team members. Pay attention to these effects and use them effectively to obtain their benefits in battle.

● The trial characters available in this gameplay mode will inherit the same Constellation levels of the characters owned by the Traveler.
