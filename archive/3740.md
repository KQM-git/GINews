● Once the event has started, a new challenge will be unlocked each day. Each of these will have a "Surge" and "Steadfast" mode.

● Surge Mode features three difficulty levels: Perilous, Quandary, and Desperate. Completing it at a higher difficulty will automatically complete the lower difficulties.

● Steadfast Mode only unlocks after completing Desperate difficulty in Surge Mode.

● Each challenge has two completion criteria, and both of them must be completed for the challenge to be considered a success.

● Each challenge features unique Blade Mirage Mechanics that have their own special effects. Take note of them and use them to your advantage during the challenges.

※ Changing your World Level will not affect the difficulty of said event challenges.
