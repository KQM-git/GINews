Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

Presently, Dendro Cores produced by Bloom reactions would cause some characters' skill effects to be triggered incorrectly. We are diagnosing the issue and will fix the problem in future updates. Please stay tuned for future notices.

There is an issue under certain circumstances whereby after the character Dori casts her Elemental Skill several times quickly within a short period of time, there is a chance that the number of Elemental Particles generated, and the effect of her Passive Talent "Compound Interest" may be abnormal. This issue will be fixed in the Version 3.1 update.

Presently, while challenging Fayz Trials on certain Android devices, some Travelers will encounter graphic glitches, whereby characters and enemies cannot be seen clearly due to model anomalies. For a temporary solution, Travelers can go to "Settings > Graphics" to adjust the "Render Resolution" to medium or lower settings. If the issue exists still, Travelers may submit feedback through "Paimon Menu > Feedback."

There is an issue under specific circumstances whereby players are unable to send messages in the dialogue window when playing on mobile devices. Travelers who encounter this issue can exit via the Paimon Menu and log back in to the game, or enter and exit an indoor environment (such as the Favonius Cathedral and the Knights of Favonius Headquarters) as a temporary fix. If the issue persists, Travelers can report the issue through the Feedback tab in the Paimon Menu.

There is an issue whereby effects gained based on a character's attribute were incorrectly increased (excluding when an effect confers one attribute as a certain percentage of another attribute). The affected effects include:

Effect of the Weapon "Hunter's Path"

The Dendro Traveler's Passive Talent "Verdant Luxury"

Tighnari's Passive Talent "Scholarly Blade"

This issue will be fixed in the Version 3.1 update.

There is an issue whereby the Voice-Over Unlock Criteria for Collei's line "About Fischl" in Profile > Voice-Over is abnormal. This issue will be fixed in the Version 3.1 update. The Unlock Criteria after the fix will be "Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 4."

Currently, there is an issue of abnormal color display in some features (such as meteorites summoned by the Geo Traveler's Elemental Skill, Paimon's cloak, Elemental Sight, etc.) in areas affected by "The Withering." This issue will be fixed in a future version.

Fixes an issue under specific circumstances whereby when carrying out the quest objective "Talk to Arakunti" in the World Quest "Slumbering Roots," the quest could not continue as the NPC Arakunti disappeared abnormally. Travelers who experience this issue can return to where the "branch" is and speak to the NPC Arakunti to continue to progress in the quest.

Fixes an issue under specific circumstances whereby the quest objectives "Talk to Arama" or "Defeat Marana's Avatar" in the World Quest "For All Children Who Long for Life" could not be completed. Travelers who are unable to complete the objective "Talk to Arama" can head to where "Marana's Avatar" is located to continue the quest. Travelers who are unable to complete the objective "Defeat Marana's Avatar" can continue the quest by following the quest guide.
