Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

There is an issue whereby the Voice-Over Unlock Criteria for Collei's line "About Fischl" in Profile > Voice-Over is abnormal. This issue will be fixed in the Version 3.1 update. The Unlock Criteria after the fix will be "Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 4."

Currently, there is an issue of abnormal color display in some features (such as meteorites summoned by the Geo Traveler's Elemental Skill, Paimon's cloak, Elemental Sight, etc.) in areas affected by "The Withering." This issue will be fixed in a future version.

Fixes an issue whereby after the Version 3.0 update, the Furnishing Blueprint quest reward "Pear Orchard Stage: Yun-Han Style" could not be obtained after completing the World Quest "On the Stage, Behind the Stage." We will send out the corresponding quest reward via in-game mail using centralized distribution within 36 hours for Travelers who have encountered this issue before the fix.

Fixes an issue under specific circumstances whereby after completing the quest objective "Unlock the road ahead using the Rhythm of the Beastly Trail" of the World Quest "The Rhythm that Reveals the Beastly Trail," the road did not open properly.

Fixes an issue whereby there is a localization error in Japanese for Tighnari's Passive Talent "Scholarly Blade."
