*After the Version 4.4 update, as long as you have completed Archon Quest Prologue: Act III "Song of the Dragon and Freedom," a Teleport Waypoint will be automatically unlocked near Liyue's Chenyu Vale: Upper Vale.

If you have already completed this Archon Quest, the Teleport Waypoint will be unlocked after the update. You'll also receive the Primogem reward for this Teleport Waypoint when it unlocks automatically.
