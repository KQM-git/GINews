**〓Event Details〓**

● After the event begins, a new Perilous Exploration will be unlocked every day for you to explore. Each exploration consists of 3 combat rounds.

● Each exploration has 4 difficulties, and the level of the opponents in the first 3 of these difficulties will be decided according to the Traveler's highest World Level. The difficulty and level of opponents in the final difficulty, Dire, is fixed.

● Character selection is available before each round of combat. When the number of non-repeated characters you use reaches a specific amount within a single dangerous area, a stackable buff will be activated.

● Only 1 buff stack can be activated in the 1st round, up to 2 in the 2nd round, and up to 3 in the final round.
