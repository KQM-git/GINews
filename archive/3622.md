Dear Travelers,

With the arrival of Version 3.7 for Genshin Impact, HoYoLAB's tools, likewise, have also gained related additions. Let's all take a look at what new and improved experiences this version update might bring!

| Battle Chronicle Update Details: New Battle Chronicle accomplishments can now be shared with a click, and new battle achievements have been added.

Once Travelers clear Floor 12 Chamber 3 of the Spiral Abyss, they will immediately get a message informing them of their floor progress, and share their progress with a click!

Additionally, "Genius Invokation TCG: Arena of Champions" card ranks in the Battle Chronicle offer new glorious memories worth recording.
