Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

- There is an issue whereby there is an error in the reset time interval for Chiori, Clorinde, and Sethos's Normal Attack sequence compared to previous versions after the Version 4.8 update. This issue will be fixed in a subsequent update.

- There is an issue whereby the position of the relevant special effect would be abnormal when Wriothesley gains the effect "Gracious Rebuke" after the Version 4.8 update. This issue will be fixed in a subsequent update.

Travelers affected by the issue can log out via the Paimon Menu and log in again to proceed with the quest as normal.

- Fixes an issue under certain circumstances whereby after the Traveler defeats the "evil dragon" in Simulanka for the final time in the Story Quest "Until the End of the World," a barrier will appear abnormally and characters are unable to jump down, resulting in an inability to complete the quest.

Fixes an issue whereby after Travelers successfully guide the Magic Tonic to pass through the pipes for the quest objective "Help the forest dwellers with Nilou” in the Story Quest "The Story Begins in a Forest Without Rain," the treasure chest will disappear abnormally if they do not open said chest promptly under certain circumstances

Travelers who encountered this issue may exit the game via the Paimon Menu, close the game client, and log into the game again. Head to the pipes at the "Forest of Blessings" and the relevant chest will appear as normal.
