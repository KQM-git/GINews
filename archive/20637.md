Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

- In the "Detailed Rules" interface of "Genius Invokation TCG," there is an error in the effect description of the Combat Status "Burst Scan" of the Character Card "Kaveh": the effect of "After this, deal Dendro DMG equal to the original Elemental Dice Cost of the card you discard +1" should actually be "After this, deal Dendro DMG equal to the original Elemental Dice Cost of the card you discard." This description error will be fixed in Version 5.0.

- There is an issue whereby there is an error in the background image of Kirara's outfit "Phantom in Boots." This issue will be fixed in Version 5.0.

- Fixes an issue whereby "Toy Bombs" cannot be properly installed on "Toytanium" under certain circumstances.

- Fixes an issue under certain circumstances whereby Travelers could not enter the "House of Daena" and characters from the Archon Quest "Jnagarbha Day" were occupied while simultaneously playing through the Archon Quest "Jnagarbha Day" and World Quest "An Odd Textual Mystery," which prevented progress in both quests.

- In "Genius Invokation TCG," the effects of "Dunyarzad," "Jeht," and "Silver and Melus" generated by "Puca's Support" did not trigger consistently as if these cards were played directly from the Hand. These three cards have been temporarily removed from the "companions" that can be generated by "Puca's Support". This issue will be fixed in Version 5.0.
