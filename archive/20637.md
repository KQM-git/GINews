Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

- There is an issue whereby after Travelers successfully guide the Magic Tonic to pass through the pipes for the quest objective "Help the forest dwellers with Nilou” in the Story Quest "The Story Begins in a Forest Without Rain," the treasure chest will disappear abnormally if they do not open said chest promptly under certain circumstances. This issue will be fixed in the update on July 25. After the fix, Travelers will be able to obtain the relevant treasure chest as intended.

- There is an issue whereby there is an error in the background image of Kirara's outfit "Phantom in Boots." This issue will be fixed in Version 5.0.

Rolled back the fix to the issue whereby "Neuvillette could rotate at an unusually high speed when casting his Charged Attack, resulting in an abnormal attack range."
