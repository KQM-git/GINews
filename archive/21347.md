〓Known Issues〓

There's an issue in Events Overview whereby the eligibility for "The Clink Clank Whiz-Kid!" and for "A Dance of Snowy Tides and Hoarfrost Groves" (as displayed in both Events Overview and Homeward Path) are not fully shown. The actual requirements are: Complete Song of the Welkin Moon — Prelude "The Journey Home" and Archon Quest Interlude Chapter: Act IV "Paralogism." This issue will be fixed in a future update, please stay tuned for an official announcement.
