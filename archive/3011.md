Hello, Travelers~

We've upgraded several modules of the Battle Chronicle such as "Real-Time Notes," "Character Overview," "Perilous Trail," and "Spiral Abyss." Come and have a look~

1. Added "Real-Time Notes > Parametric Transformer Cooldown" Notification function

During the Cooldown process of the Parametric Transformer, you can enable the "Notification" function in Real-Time Notes. When the Cooldown ends, HoYoLAB will notify you at the first moment.

*You must authorize HoYoLAB to send you notifications to use this function, which can only be used during the Parametric Transformer Cooldown. The notification is only valid for this Cooldown.

2. Added "Share > Save Image" function

The "Share > Save Image" function has been added on the homepage, character details page, and character overview page, making it easy for Travelers to share their own Battle Chronicle.

3. Added the Battle Chronicle for the limited-time event "Perilous Trail"

4. Optimized the UI layout for "Spiral Abyss" on mobile devices

And that's all for the update description of this Battle Chronicle! You can check it out for yourself by going to Tools > Battle Chronicle on HoYoLAB~
