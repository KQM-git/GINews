〓Special Rules〓

● In this edition of Heated Battle Mode, Travelers must randomly draw characters and powerful supporting forces to form lineups and do consecutive battles.

● Character Cards now have ATK stats. The higher the character's ATK is, the higher the DMG they deal.

● Character Cards now have both levels and ranks. You can increase your characters' levels by selecting duplicate characters from the available rewards. Leveling up a character increases their ATK and Max HP. When your characters reach certain levels, you can upgrade their ranks. After ranking up, characters can gain rank rewards or enhance their skills.

● Before each battle, Travelers can play Event Cards or Equipment Cards to further build the characters, or rearrange the order of the Character Cards.

● After the battle begins, characters from both sides will automatically take actions in order from left to right.

● In this edition of Heated Battle Mode, the effects of certain Elemental reactions and cards will be adjusted. A new Elemental Mastery attribute has been added, increasing it will significantly boost Elemental Reaction effects.
