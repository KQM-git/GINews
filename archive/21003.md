〓Event Details〓

● From the first day of the event, a new stage will unlock every day. A total of five stages will be unlocked.

● Following the synopses, you must select appropriate assets for each shot, then compile them into a complete sequence and finish editing. Each asset can be used a maximum of 3 times for the same script.

● By editing in line with the Synopsis, you can earn Rave reviews.

● Once you've received a Rave review, you'll no longer be restricted by the script limitations, enabling you to decide the total number of assets you use and experiment freely by creating Final Cuts of different lengths.
