## Online Top-Up Center


Dear Travelers, the official Top-Up Center is now available on the Genshin Impact website. Interested Travelers can check it out by following the link below to the website.

[Go to Website](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en)

From the homepage, simply select the "Top Up" button at the top of the page to access the Top Up Center.

Before making any payments, please check that the UID you are topping up matches your account. (You can check your UID in-game by opening the Paimon Menu.) When topping up a UID, any purchases will be automatically applied to the corresponding game account.

Travelers are advised that there may be a delay between topping up and receiving the items in-game.

If you have any questions about topping up, please send us an email at genshin_payment@hoyoverse.com
