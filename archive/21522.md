〓Event Details〓

● Travelers need to visit the designated photo-taking spots to complete photo-taking challenges. Two new photo-taking spots will be added each day for the first five days of the event.

● In the first phase of the challenge, make the correct poses based on the silhouettes provided. Use the "Shutterflash" Kamera to capture the moment that matches the silhouette.

● In the second phase of the challenge, the camera needs to be adjusted to complete the composition of the picture. When the character and the silhouette provided are aligned to a certain extent, a picture may be taken to complete the challenge.

● During the event, you can claim rewards on the event menu the first time you complete the photo-taking at each photo-taking spot.
