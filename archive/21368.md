〓Special Rules〓

● In Heated Battle Mode: Automatic Artistry, Travelers must randomly draw characters and powerful supporting forces to form lineups and do consecutive battles.

● In Automatic Artistry, Character Cards have ATK stats. The higher the character's ATK is, the higher the DMG they deal.

● In Automatic Artistry, Character Cards have both levels and ranks. You can increase your characters' levels by selecting duplicate characters from the available rewards. Leveling up a character increases their ATK and Max HP. When your characters reach certain levels, you can ascend their ranks. After ranking up, characters can gain rank rewards or enhance their skills.

● Before each battle, Travelers can play Event Cards or Equipment Cards to further build the characters, or rearrange the order of the characters.

● After the battle begins, characters from both sides will automatically take actions in order from left to right.
