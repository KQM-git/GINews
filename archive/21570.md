Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

- There is an issue whereby under certain circumstances, after achieving victory in the Trounce Domain "False Moon Institute," Travelers may still find the "The Doctor" entry locked in the "Living Beings" section of the Archive.

Travelers affected by the above issue can defeat The Doctor outside the rift from beyond this world to unlock the entry as intended. This issue will be fixed in a future update.

- The devs will optimize the background music for a cutscene animation in the Archon Quest "True Moon" after the "Luna V" update. This optimized version of the background music will also be used in the upcoming official cutscene animation video.

- Currently, when Neuvillette performed certain actions (such as moving, Normal Attacks, etc.) after using his Elemental Burst while wearing to the outfit "Melusent Gift," the back of the outfit lacks the fluttering effect. This issue will be fixed in the Version "Luna V" update.

- Fixes an issue whereby, under certain circumstances, the ribbons on the weapon "Nocturne's Curtain Call" could appear abnormally elongated when viewed in the Character > Weapon screen.

- Fixes an issue in Stygian Onslaught whereby the challenge time for Battlefield 1 and Battlefield 3 on Normal, Advancing, and Hard difficulties was incorrectly set to 120s. The time has now been corrected to 600s.

- Fixes an issue in Portuguese whereby there was a localization error in the effect description of the weapon "Bloodsoaked Ruins."

- Fixes an issue in Russian whereby there were localization errors in the names of Constellation Levels 1–5 for Illuga.

- Fixes an issue whereby the game could crash on Android devices equipped with the UNISOC T606 processor when compiling shaders during startup.

Note: Android devices equipped with the UNISOC T606 processor fall below the game's current supported specifications. Even if the game can launch on these devices, performance may be unstable, and issues such as frequent crashes or lag may occur.

Travelers affected by the above issues can log out via the Paimon Menu by selecting "Exit to Login Interface" and close the game, then log in again to resolve the issues.
