Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

- There is an issue whereby under certain circumstances, after achieving victory in the Trounce Domain "False Moon Institute," Travelers may still find the "The Doctor" entry locked in the "Living Beings" section of the Archive.

Travelers affected by the above issue can defeat The Doctor outside the rift from beyond this world to unlock the entry as intended. This issue will be fixed in a future update.

- The devs will optimize the background music for a cutscene animation in the Archon Quest "True Moon" after the "Luna V" update. This optimized version of the background music will also be used in the upcoming official cutscene animation video.

- Currently, when Neuvillette performed certain actions (such as moving, Normal Attacks, etc.) after using his Elemental Burst while wearing to the outfit "Melusent Gift," the back of the outfit lacks the fluttering effect. This issue will be fixed in the Version "Luna V" update.
