Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

There is an issue with Mika whereby the Stamina consumed for his Charged Attack is erroneous. The Stamina Cost is currently 20, and will be corrected to 25 subsequently. This issue will be fixed in the update on March 30, and we will issue compensation accordingly.  Please stay tuned for future notices regarding the updated content and corresponding compensation.

There is an issue under certain circumstances whereby Hydro applications on characters or enemies cannot be removed normally. Travelers who experience this issue can exit the game via the Paimon Menu before logging in again as a temporary fix. This issue will be fixed in a future version.
