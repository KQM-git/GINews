Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

- There is an issue whereby when carrying out the World Quests "Capturing Light and Shadow" or "Returning Curios" in Co-Op Mode, the host is unable to obtain the Mora treasure chest related to the "Choo-Choo Cart" gameplay under specific circumstances. We will issue the treasure chest reward via an in-game mail to all affected Travelers after the end of Version 3.8.

- The World Quest "A Starry Night, as Remembered" is a limited-time quest, and cannot be accepted and completed after the end of Version 3.8. Travelers, please note the quest period.

- There is an issue in Genius Invokation TCG whereby when the Character Card "Eula" gains Grimheart, the DMG value indicated in the Elemental Skill description will be abnormally stated as "Deals 4 Cryo DMG" (the actual DMG dealt is as intended, and is 5 Cryo DMG). This issue will be fixed in a future version. Please stay tuned for future notices.

- Fixes an issue whereby the Jadeplume Terrorshroom's movement is abnormal in Spiral Abyss Floor 12 Chamber 2.

- Fixes an issue in which enemies might behave abnormally and break away from combat in Domains for certain Quests. After the fixes, the pathfinding logic of in-Domain enemies might still have abnormalities, and will be fixed in future updates.

- Fixed an issue in Italian whereby the text in "Battle Pass > Missions" was displayed abnormally.

Travelers affected by the above issues can log out via the Paimon Menu and close the game client, then log in again to continue the game as normal.

Fixes an issue whereby some Travelers would encounter a system notification stating "Failed to read database. Error code: 22-4302" and thus are unable to log into the game. Our developers will distribute compensation to affected Travelers via in-game mail within 24 hours after the issue is fixed. The mail is valid for 30 days, please remember to claim it in time.
