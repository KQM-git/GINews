〓Event Duration〓

2024/04/29 – 2024/05/06 23:59:59 (global)

*Rewards cannot be claimed after the event ends. Please claim them in time.

〓Eligibility〓

Travelers who have reached Adventure Rank 10 or above can participate in this event.

〓Event Description〓

During the event, you can log in to Genshin Impact daily, claim Daily Commission Rewards, consume Original Resin, and complete other missions to obtain Inspiration. Inspiration can be used to create various drinks with different recipes based on customers' preferences. Accumulate positive ratings from customers to obtain Primogems and other rewards.

〓Obtain Inspiration〓

You can obtain Inspiration through the following methods:

1. Complete the following actions in Genshin Impact every day, including: log into Genshin Impact every day, consume 40 Original Resin daily, etc.

2. Complete the following actions on the website, such as: logging into the web event daily, etc.

3. Daily missions refresh daily at 04:00 (Server Time).

*Inspiration needs to be collected manually in the event page. Inspiration that has not been collected will also be reset when daily missions are refreshed the next day, so remember to collect it!

*If Travelers try to visit the event at around 04:00 (Server Time), which is when the daily missions refresh, they may encounter a brief network error. Please refresh the page if you encounter this error.

〓Making Drinks〓

1. After obtaining Inspiration, you can check the hints given by different customers at the trailer and try to figure out the correct recipe based on the hints. Each drink requires three ingredients, one each from the Base, Adjunct, and Flavoring areas.

2. Some customers come with a special ingredient, and while making their requested drinks, you must add the corresponding special ingredient.

3. Drag the completed drink to the customer to receive feedback on whether the recipe is correct. If the recipe is correct, 10 Inspiration will be deducted, and you'll receive 1 positive rating from said customer. If the recipe is incorrect, the customer will provide a more detailed hint! (No Inspiration will be deducted at this point.)

4. There is no limit to the supply of ingredients. You can try making different drinks as many times as you want.

5. Unlocked recipes can be found in the "Drinks Menu" of the archive.

*If you exit in the middle of the making process, the progress of the drink currently being made will not be saved.
