I. New Characters

<details open="true">
<summary><span style="color:rgba(204,144,70,1)"><span>5-Star Character "Helm of the Radiant Rose" Navia (Geo)</span></span></summary>

◇ Vision: Geo

◇ Weapon: Claymore

◇ The current President of Spina di Rosula, who is lovely, dutiful, and a great boss.

◆ Elemental Skill: Ceremonial Crystalshot

◆ When a character in a party with Navia obtains an Elemental Shard created from the Crystallize reaction, Navia will gain Crystal Shrapnel. When she fires, Navia will fire multiple Rosula Shardshots that can penetrate opponents, dealing Geo DMG. The more Rosula Shardshots that strike opponents, the greater the DMG dealt to them. Unleashing Navia's Elemental Skill will consume accumulated Crystal Shrapnel stacks, and the number of Rosula Shardshots and DMG dealt by "Ceremonial Crystalshot" will be increased based on the number of Crystal Shrapnel stacks. Hold the Elemental Skill to enter Aiming Mode and continually collect Elemental Shards nearby.

◆ Elemental Burst: As the Sunlit Sky's Singing Salute

◆ Call for a magnificent Rosula Dorata Salute. Unleashes a massive cannon bombardment on opponents in front of her, dealing AoE Geo DMG and providing Cannon Fire Support for a duration afterward, periodically dealing Geo DMG. When cannon attacks hit opponents, Navia will gain 1 stack of Crystal Shrapnel.

◇ Vision: Pyro

◇ Weapon: Polearm

◇ The captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, who wears justice as an ever-present seal upon her heart. Her musket shall only ever point at the guilty.

◆ Elemental Skill: Short-Range Rapid Interdiction Fire

◆ Fires at her opponent(s), dealing AoE Pyro DMG. If a nearby character in the party triggers an Overloaded reaction, Chevreuse gains 1 Overcharged Ball, increasing the AoE and DMG of her Elemental Skill. After Chevreuse fires a shot, she will continuously restore HP to the active character on the field.

◆ Elemental Burst: Ring of Bursting Grenades

◆ Fires an explosive grenade at opponents, dealing AoE Pyro DMG. After the projectile hits, it will split into many secondary explosive shells. These shells will burst after a short interval, dealing Pyro DMG.

When the duration expires, the Yearning effect will be transformed into the "Waves of Days Past" effect: When your active party member hits an opponent with a Normal Attack, Charged Attack, Plunging Attack, Elemental Skill, or Elemental Burst, the DMG dealt will be increased by 8% of the total healing amount recorded by the Yearning effect. The "Waves of Days Past" effect is removed after it has taken effect 5 times or after 10s. A single instance of the Yearning effect can record up to 15,000 healing, and only a single instance can exist at once, but it can record the healing from multiple equipping characters. Equipping characters on standby can still trigger this effect.
