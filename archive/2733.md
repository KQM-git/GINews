〓Update Details〓

I. New Characters

5-Star Character "Lonesome Transcendence" Shenhe (Cryo)

◇ Vision: Cryo

◇ Weapon: Polearm

◇ An adepti disciple with a most unusual air about her. Having spent much time cultivating in isolation in Liyue's mountains, she has become every bit as cool and distant as the adepti themselves.

◆ Shenhe's Elemental Skill, "Spring Spirit Summoning," can produce different effects based on how it is used: when pressed, she will rush forward and deal Cryo DMG, whereas when held, she will deal AoE Cryo DMG in front of her. These two different usage methods will provide teammates with Icy Quill effects that will be triggered for a different number of times based on the usage method. Icy Quill increases Cryo DMG dealt by characters' Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks, Elemental Skills, and Elemental Bursts based on Shenhe's own ATK.

Her Elemental Burst, "Divine Maiden's Deliverance," deals sustained AoE Cryo DMG to opponents in the field, and also decreases the Cryo RES and Physical RES of opponents in the field.

4-Star Character "Stage Lucida" Yun Jin (Geo)

◇ Vision: Geo

◇ Weapon: Polearm

◇ A renowned Liyue opera singer who is skilled in both playwriting and singing. Her style is one-of-a-kind, exquisite and delicate, much like the person herself.

◆ When Yun Jin uses her Elemental Skill, "Opening Flourish," she charges upward, forming a shield. After the skill button is released, when its duration ends, or when the shield breaks, it will deal Geo DMG. DMG dealt is based on Yun Jin's DEF, and Shield DMG Absorption is based on Yun Jin's Max HP.

Her Elemental Burst "Cliffbreaker's Banner," deals a one-time AoE Geo DMG to nearby opponents and grants all nearby party members a "Flying Cloud Flag Formation" which will increase DMG dealt by Normal Attacks. The increase will be based on Yun Jin's own DEF. Flying Cloud Flag Formation will disappear when the number of times is used up or at the end of the duration.

◆ During the event wish "The Transcendent One Returns," the event-exclusive 5-star character "Lonesome Transcendence" Shenhe (Cryo) and 4-star character "Stage Lucida" Yun Jin (Geo) will get a huge drop-rate boost!

• All party members' Normal Attack DMG increased by 50%.

Floor 12 Ley Line Disorders changed to:

The RES lost this way will be reset every 20s.

Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 2.4, the three Lunar Phases will be as follows：

Phase I:

Blade-Flourish Moon

When the active character's Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attacks hit opponents multiple times within 2s, that character's Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attack DMG is increased by 5% for 8s. Max 15 stacks. This effect can be triggered once every 0.1s and will be cleared if the character goes down or leaves the field.

Phase II:

Blooming Moon

When the active character hits opponents with attacks that are considered Normal Attack DMG, there is a 50% chance of unleashing a shockwave at the hit opponent's position, dealing AoE True DMG. One shockwave can be released in this way every 0.3s.

Phase III: 

Awakening Moon

When the active character's Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attacks hit opponents multiple times within 2s, the character gains a stack of Emergence for 8s. This effect can be triggered once every 0.1s. Emergence will be cleared when the character goes down or leaves the field. When the character gains 15 Emergence stacks, the stacks will be cleared and a shockwave will be unleashed that deals True DMG to nearby opponents. After a shockwave is unleashed in this way, all party members will deal 25% increased DMG for 10s.
