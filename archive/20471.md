Dear Travelers,

Our developers are expected to begin performing update maintenance at 2024/04/24 06:00:00 (global). Please stay tuned to related game update information.

In this update, the logic of some game files have been adjusted to optimize the gaming experience, meaning that the pre-installation and update process will require a large amount of space. Once the update is complete, the game file size may be smaller compared to the size before pre-installation.

We recommend that you save sufficient space on your device and complete this download over a Wi-Fi connection.

The pre-installation resource package size for PCs will be between 28.72–36.2 GB. The pre-installation resource package size for mobile devices will be between 8.57–9.9 GB (the voice-over files installed will affect the size of the space required for pre-installation).

Regardless of whether you complete pre-installation, any content you download in advance will increase the download speed during the version update.
