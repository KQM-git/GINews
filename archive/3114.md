Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

There is an issue with the "Hidden Strife" event whereby there is a chance that characters are unable to trigger the relevant counts for the criteria "Deal DMG to opponents when using Claymores 15 times" or "Deal DMG with Normal Attacks 20 times" under specific circumstances, resulting in the inability to obtain "Afterimaged Might." Travelers who experience this issue can exit the game via the Paimon Menu and log in again as a temporary fix.

There is an issue after the Version 2.8 update whereby some enemies (such as Geovishap Hatchling) have a small chance of displaying abnormal target tracking when casting their skills. This issue will be fixed in a later update, please stay tuned to our announcements.

Continuous attacks have a very low probability of abnormally and significantly extending the duration of various effects on the character Kamisato Ayato (up to twice the duration), including but not limited to the "Takimeguri Kanka" state from his Elemental Skill, "Corrosion", and "Smoldering Flames" that are applied to the character.

The developers have detected the initial cause of this issue. As the fix involves fundamental logic, this issue will be fixed in Version 3.0 after comprehensive testing.

*Note: The fix will not affect the abnormal increase in duration caused by hit lag, or Plunging Attacks that can be performed from jumping on a flat surface due to hit lag.

When using an iOS or Android device to play the game, after some characters cast their Elemental Bursts, there may be a problem with their weapons' color display. This issue will be fixed in a later version update. Please stay tuned for future notices.
