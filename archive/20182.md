**〓Event Details〓**

● During the event, check the treasure map within Ulman's Treasure Book. Follow the map to reach the area where the treasure is buried. Ulman will mark out one new area in this book each day, for a total of 6 treasure areas.

● Help the Treasure-Seeking Seelie absorb energy in various ways in the treasure area to help it restore vitality. For every 3 instances of elemental energy obtained, the Treasure-Seeking Seelie will indicate the whereabouts of the treasure once.

● Dig in a treasure area to find the treasure chest and claim the "Ancient Iron Coins" within.

● During the event, you can exchange "Ancient Iron Coins" for materials in the Event Shop. After the event ends, your remaining "Ancient Iron Coins" will disappear.

※ Upon completing Area 6, the Event Shop will open for the redemption of "Mini Seelie: Brilliance," "Mini Seelie: Moss," "Mini Seelie: Viola," "Mini Seelie: Dayflower," "Mini Seelie: Rosé," and "Mini Seelie: Curcuma." During this event, Travelers may only exchange for one type, after which the remaining five will no longer be available. Each Mini Seelie can only be obtained once.
