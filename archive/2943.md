〓Known Issues〓

There is a localization error in Korean regarding the description of Kamisato Ayato's Elemental Burst in the "Test Run" event. The developers are already working to fix this issue, please stay tuned for future notices regarding the exact time of the fix.

When using an iOS or Android device to play the game, after some characters cast their Elemental Bursts, there may be a problem with their weapons' color display. This issue will be fixed in a later version update. Please stay tuned for future notices.

After updating the official driver released by Razer on January 20, some Travelers using Razer devices on PC may experience a crash error when logging in to the game.
