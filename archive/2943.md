Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

Continuous attacks have a very low probability of abnormally and significantly extending the duration of various effects on the character Kamisato Ayato (up to twice the duration), including but not limited to the "Takimeguri Kanka" state from his Elemental Skill, "Corrosion", and "Smoldering Flames" that are applied to the character.

The developers have detected the initial cause of this issue. As the fix involves fundamental logic, this issue will be fixed in Version 3.0 after comprehensive testing.

*Note: The fix will not affect the abnormal increase in duration caused by hit lag, or Plunging Attacks that can be performed from jumping on a flat surface due to hit lag.

There is a localization error in Korean regarding the description of Kamisato Ayato's Elemental Burst in the "Test Run" event. The developers are already working to fix this issue, please stay tuned for future notices regarding the exact time of the fix.

When using an iOS or Android device to play the game, after some characters cast their Elemental Bursts, there may be a problem with their weapons' color display. This issue will be fixed in a later version update. Please stay tuned for future notices.

After updating the official driver released by Razer on January 20, some Travelers using Razer devices on PC may experience a crash error when logging in to the game. Travelers who encounter this problem can try to uninstall the Razer driver first and restart the computer as a temporary fix. If the issue persists, please contact us via the email Genshin_cs@hoyoverse.com.
