〓Update Details〓

I. New Areas

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ Legend has it that in the depths of the boundless desert lies a forbidden realm where few have ever set foot. Beneath the barren wasteland, along with the ruins of an ancient civilization and the legacy of the divine, only a hidden lost Darshan and mythical creatures safeguard the long-sealed memories...

◇ New Areas: In Version 3.6, the areas, Gavireh Lajavard and Realm of Farakhkert in the Sumeru region will be available.

In addition, there will be new Fishing Points and "Radiant Spincrystals" in the new areas.

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Plumes of Purifying Light can be found scattered across the land defended by Khvarena. Some of them have to be obtained via special methods.

Offer Plumes of Purifying Light to the Amrita Pool to increase its level, granting you the blessings of the waters and trees. Each time you make an offering, the Amrita Pool will randomly give different blessings. After 6 offerings have been given, you will obtain rewards from all the blessings.

◇ Unlock Criteria: Complete the World Quest "Heart of Amrita"

II. New Characters

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ Vision: Dendro

◇ Weapon: Catalyst

◇ The owner of Bubu Pharmacy, who is rarely seen without the white snake named Changsheng. His medicinal knowledge is encyclopedic, and his personal intrigues subtle.

◆ Elemental Skill "Universal Diagnosis"

◆ Baizhu controls a Gossamer Sprite that cruises and attacks nearby opponents, dealing Dendro DMG. After it performs 3 attacks or if there are no opponents nearby, the Sprite will return, healing all nearby party members based on Baizhu's Max HP.

◆ Elemental Burst "Holistic Revivification"

◆ Baizhu enters the Pulsing Clarity state, creating a Seamless Shield that absorbs Dendro DMG with 250% effectiveness. While in this state, Baizhu will generate a new Seamless Shield every 2.5s. When a new Seamless Shield is generated, or when the Seamless Shield's effects expire, or when it is shattered, the Seamless Shield will heal your own active character based on Baizhu's Max HP and attack opponents by unleashing Spiritveins, dealing Dendro DMG.

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ Vision: Dendro

◇ Weapon: Claymore

◇ A renowned architect from Sumeru who perhaps cares a bit too much about too many things. He is an aesthete troubled by reality.

◆ Elemental Skill "Artistic Ingenuity"

◆ Kaveh uses Mehrak's mapping ability for offensive purposes, initiating a radial scan that deals AoE Dendro DMG. It will also scan all Dendro Cores in its AoE and cause them to immediately burst.

◆ Elemental Burst "Painted Dome"

◆ Kaveh completely unleashes Mehrak's energy and creates a cubic scanned space, dealing AoE Dendro DMG to all opponents within it, causing all Dendro Cores in its AoE to immediately burst. For a specific duration, it increases Kaveh's Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attack AoE, converts his attack DMG to Dendro DMG that cannot be overridden, and increases Kaveh's resistance to interruption. In addition, all Dendro Cores created by all your own party members through Bloom reactions will deal additional DMG when they burst. These effects will be canceled once Kaveh leaves the field.

III. New Domains

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ Legend has it that the territory of the red desert was marked by an ancient barrier of iron and bronze. The Lord of the Blazing Sun used to set out from here on his chariot to drive away the evil spirits wandering among the grim mountains. However, the gilded nations later sank into the sand and towering parapets of iron and bronze thus faded into oblivion along with their parent nations, leaving only unrecognizable ruins.

◇ Unlock Criteria:

Reach Adventure Rank 22 or above

Or complete Archon Quest Prologue: Act III "Song of the Dragon and Freedom"

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain artifacts in the "Nymph's Dream" and "Vourukasha's Glow" sets.

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ The fragrant sea underneath the desert is still as luxuriant today as it has always been. Nobody knows when the marvelous sentient Fungi moved in and became part of the ecology of the underground ocean.

◇ Unlock Criteria:

Reach Adventure Rank 40 or above and fulfill certain criteria.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems and Dendro Sigils.

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ A water body said to be able to wash off all filth and connect to the sea within the earth. Perhaps because of the many similar scents and memories, it is still inhabited by monsters that devoured the remains of greater life forms.

◇ Unlock Criteria:

Reach Adventure Rank 40 or above and fulfill certain criteria.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems and Dendro Sigils.

Primordial Jade Regalia will still take effect even if the equipping character is not on the field.

◆ During the event wish "Epitome Invocation," the event-exclusive 5-star weapon Jadefall's Splendor (Catalyst) will receive a huge drop-rate boost!

2. New Artifacts

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ 2-Piece Set: Hydro DMG Bonus +15%.

◇ 4-Piece Set: After Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks, Elemental Skills, and Elemental Bursts hit opponents, 1 stack of Mirrored Nymph will be triggered, lasting 8s. When under the effect of 1, 2, or 3 or more Mirrored Nymph stacks, ATK will be increased by 7%/16%/25%, and Hydro DMG Bonus will be increased by 4%/9%/15%. Mirrored Nymph stacks created by Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks, Elemental Skills, and Elemental Bursts exist independently.

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">◇ 2-Piece Set: HP +20%.

4-Piece Set: Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst DMG will be increased by 10%. After the equipping character takes DMG, the aforementioned DMG Bonus is increased by 80% for 5s.
