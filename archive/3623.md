Dear Travelers,

New Version 3.7 Genshin Impact tool upgrades have been added to the Card Plaza, offering Travelers a brand-new user experience. Let's look over what's new together!

Card Plaza Now Available on PC

Supports the quick-viewing, editing, and sharing of Genius Invokation TCG decks on PC.

More Efficient Deck Exchanges

Players can use the "Click to generate image" button on the top-right corner of the Deck Details page to save an image of their deck and share it on HoYoLAB.

Just as the Card Plaza allows for the publishing of one's deck, it also allows for the uploading of live duels in the form of YouTube videos. The combat experience and functional use of decks have thus been made more intuitive.

New Popular Tags Section

The Popular Tags section will display decks that are presently tagged as popular in the Card Plaza. Travelers can click the tags to review the corresponding decks and easily inquire about popular content.

New Cards Await

Combined with Genshin Impact Version 3.7's release, this Card Plaza will feature the newly-added Version 3.7 Character and Action Cards. This will give you more choices when building decks.
