May 26 Update

Update Details: Rolls back the restrictions added to the renaming of the character "Wanderer" after the Version 3.7 update.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to some Travelers who received in-game warning mails when they attempted to rename their character as per normal, due to naming restrictions added in Version 3.7, which negatively impacted players' gaming experience.

This change has been rolled back. Previously approved names will not be forcibly reset by the system, and Travelers will not receive in-game warning mails for choosing a name that is the same as an in-game NPC or character.

We will adjust the relevant reminder mails and optimize the relevant system in future versions.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused.

▌Compensation Details

Primogems ×60

Item "An Appellative Stroke" ×1

▌Scope of Compensation

Travelers who had their Wanderer's "name" reset abnormally after the Version 3.7 update.

Our developers will distribute compensation to Travelers via in-game mail within 24 hours after the issue is fixed. The mail is valid for 30 days, please remember to claim it in time.
