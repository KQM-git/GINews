Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓2023/05/26 11:05:00 (global) Update Details〓

Fixes an issue whereby there is a chance that abnormalities would occur in the game if you teleport immediately after Nahida casts "All Schemes to Know" on NPCs.

〓2023/05/25 18:10:00 (global) Update Details〓

Fixes an issue whereby after the Version 3.7 update, the new name that some Travelers have given to the Wanderer would be reset abnormally.

After the Version 3.7 update, Travelers who had their character's "name" reset abnormally will be able to change it back to the name before the version update.

We will optimize the relevant system in future versions.

▌Compensation Details

Primogems ×60

Item "An Appellative Stroke" ×1

▌Scope of Compensation

Travelers who had their Wanderer's "name" reset abnormally after the Version 3.7 update.

Our developers will distribute compensation to Travelers via in-game mail within 24 hours after the issue is fixed. The mail is valid for 30 days, please remember to claim it in time.
