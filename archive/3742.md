I. New Area

<details open="true">
<summary><span>New Area - Fontaine</span></summary>

A story that has never been heard, a legend that has been forgotten, like a lost kingdom sunken beneath the waves, yearning for a bard to sing its drowned songs. Following the direction of pure currents, crossing wilderness, the depths of the forests and vastness of the sea of sand, arriving at the origin of all the waters of the continent.

At the top of the waterfall, in the depths of the capital atop the terrestrial sea, the curtain softly rises on the start of the adventure's next chapter.

In Version 4.0, the following areas in Fontaine will become available: Court of Fontaine Region, Beryl Region, and Belleau Region.

※ Completing the Archon Quest Prologue: Act III "Song of the Dragon and Freedom" will automatically unlock a Teleport Waypoint in the Realm of Farakhkert in Sumeru (If you have already completed this Archon Quest, the Teleport Waypoint will be unlocked after the update). Travelers can use this Teleport Waypoint to head over to Fontaine. You'll also receive the Primogem reward for this Teleport Waypoint when it unlocks automatically.

▌New Fontaine Mechanic

Fontaine's Blessing

A mysterious power that flows out from a statue to imbue you with the blessing of the Transoceanic Sourcewater.

Your progress will remain unhindered so long as you are moving through the lakes of Fontaine.

※ Currently, some gadgets equipped by characters cannot be used underwater. There is also an issue whereby after characters enter the underwater areas, the icons of the gadgets will not be displayed, which further prevents Travelers from switching to other gadgets through Quickswap. If you need to switch between gadgets, you can do it in the Inventory for now, or Quickswap to the gadgets usable underwater before you dive. This issue will be fixed in future versions.

VI. New Enemies

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Icewind Suite</span></summary>

◇ A gift from the Fontaine Research Institute, it is composed of two pieces, Dirge of Coppelia and Nemesis of Coppelius.

At the climax of the performance, Coppelia will halt at the center of the dance floor and expose her spare clockwork component charged with ousia or pneuma, thereby drastically increasing the efficiency of her exertions. During this phase, extinguishing this energy by attacking with the opposing source will overload her, thus progressing the performance.

Located in the Court of Fontaine Region

</details>

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Emperor of Fire and Iron</span></summary>

◇ An Armored Crablord that has survived for countless eons and surpassed almost all other Fontemer Aberrants.

The twin molten horns located high up on its body are Pyro-aligned organs that can unleash more vicious elemental attacks and grant it even stronger defensive capabilities. When the Armored Crablord unleashes certain attacks, its twin molten horns are closer to the ground. This provides for a great opportunity to use Elemental Reactions to remove the Pyro element within.

Located in the Belleau Region

</details>

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Shatterstone Breacher Primus, Large Shatterstone Breacher Primus, Overgrown Breacher Primus, and Large Overgrown Breacher Primus</span></summary>

◇ Strange life forms that share nothing in common with any other land-dwelling creature.

In battle, they will enter a stressed state and unleash fierce attacks while under the protection of a Geo or Dendro shield. If the shield is broken during this period, it will cause the life forms to fall into a paralyzed state. Aside from the usual methods of using Elemental Reactions, attacks imbued with ousia and pneuma can also efficiently pierce the defenses of the Breacher Primuses.

</details>

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Recon Log Mek, Arithmetic Enhancer Mek, Underwater Survey Mek, Underwater Patrol Mek, Geological Survey Mek, Nimble Harvester Mek, Area Alert Mek, Assault Specialist Mek, Suppression Specialist Mek, Annihilation Specialist Mek, Construction Specialist Mek.</span></summary>

◇ Machines created from the union between Fontaine's intricate device and special energy technologies.

Based on whether they are exhibiting ousia or pneuma energy signatures, they will operate differently in battle. When these energies are extinguished upon being attacked by its opposing energy source, it will induce an Overloaded state and cause them to lose energy, weakening their combat capabilities.

</details>

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Blubberbeast, Hunter's Ray, Armored Crab, Hat Jellyfish, Bubbly Seahorse, Ball Octopus, Angelic Sea Hare, Sternshield Crab, Bubbler Seahorse, Cherubic Sea Hare</span></summary>

◇ Aquatic life forms that have embarked on a unique evolutionary track due to Fontaine's environmental factors.

Some of them are more aggressive and can unleash fiercer elemental attacks and possess even stronger defensive capabilities. If you use Elemental Reactions to remove their Elemental Shields, things should be easier to handle.

</details>

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Tainted Water-Splitting Phantasm, Tainted Water-Spouting Phantasm</span></summary>

◇ Today, with the Oceanids extirpated from Fontaine, strange elemental life forms have appeared in the waters.

Enter stress state in combat and retaliate violently.
