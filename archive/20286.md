</details>
II. New Characters

<details open="true">
<summary><span style="color:rgba(53,150,151,1)"><span>5-Star Character "Passerine Herald" Xianyun (Anemo)</span></span></summary>

◇ Vision: Anemo

◇ Weapon: Catalyst

◇ One of the Mighty and Illuminated Adepti of Jueyun, known as "Cloud Retainer." Expert in all kinds of mechanical contraptions, her heart now turns towards the affairs of the mortal world, through which she walks under the name "Xianyun."

◆ Elemental Skill "White Clouds at Dawn"

◆ Xianyun enters the Cloud Transmogrification state, in which she will not take Fall DMG, and uses Skyladder once. In this state, Xianyun can cast Skyladder continuously to leap, where her Plunging Attack will be converted into an even stronger Driftcloud Wave instead, which deals AoE Anemo DMG. The more times Skyladder is used, the more DMG the resulting Driftcloud Wave will deal and the larger its AoE.

◆ Elemental Burst "Stars Gather at Dusk"

◆ Brings forth a sacred breeze that deals AoE Anemo DMG and heals all nearby characters. It will also summon the "Starwicker" mechanism that follows the active character and periodically heals all nearby party members. When the Starwicker has Adeptal Assistance stacks, characters will have their jump height increased. When they complete a Plunging Attack, Adeptal Assistance stacks will be consumed and deal AoE Anemo DMG.

</details>

<details open="true">
<summary><span style="color:rgba(236,73,35,1)"><span>4-Star Character "Leonine Vanguard" Gaming (Pyro)</span></span></summary>

◇ Vision: Pyro

◇ Weapon: Claymore

◇ Guard of the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency, and the head of the "Mighty Mythical Beasts" Wushou troupe.

◆ Elemental Skill "Bestial Ascent"

◆ Gaming pounces forward using the Wushou arts, leaping high into the air after coming into contact with a target or surface. If he immediately uses a Plunging Attack, he will use Plunging Attack: Charmed Cloudstrider instead, dealing AoE Pyro DMG to opponents hit.

◆ Elemental Burst "Suanni's Gilded Dance"

◆ Gaming enters Wushou Stance, briefly applying Pyro to him, recovering a fixed amount of HP, and summons his companion, the Suanni Man Chai, to smash into his target, dealing AoE Pyro DMG. After doing so, Man Chai will then attempt to roll towards Gaming. When it links up with Gaming, Man Chai will leave the field and reset the CD for Gaming's Elemental Skill, Bestial Ascent. While Wushou Stance is active, his resistance to interruption is increased, and when Gaming lands with Charmed Cloudstrider attack or completes the forward pounce attack from Bestial Ascent with over 50% HP, he will summon Man Chai again.

</details>
III. New Equipment

New Weapon (Examples based on Refinement Rank 1)

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Crane's Echoing Call (5-Star Catalyst)</span></summary>

After the equipping character hits an opponent with a Plunging Attack, all nearby party members' Plunging Attacks will deal 28% increased DMG for 20s. When nearby party members hit opponents with Plunging Attacks, they will restore 2.5 Energy to the equipping character. Energy can be restored this way every 0.7s. This energy regain effect can be triggered even if the equipping character is not on the field.

◆ During the event wish "Epitome Invocation," the event-exclusive 5-star weapon Crane's Echoing Call (Catalyst) will receive a huge drop-rate boost!

</details>

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Xingqiu: Bamboo Rain</span></summary>

◇ Formal wear prepared by the Feiyun Commerce Guild for Xingqiu. The bamboo prints are refined and the cut is most flattering, but Xingqiu's favorite aspect of the outfit is its inner pockets, into which a thinner novel might be stuffed.

◆ During Version 4.4, Travelers can obtain Xingqiu's outfit "Bamboo Rain" for free by participating in the limited-time "Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze" event.
