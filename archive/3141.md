◆ Elemental Burst: Fashioner's Tanglevine Shaft

◆ Fires 6 Tanglevine Shafts that can track opponents and deal Dendro DMG. After they hit, the Tanglevine Shafts will create a secondary wave of Tanglevine Shafts that can also track opponents and deal Dendro DMG on hit.

◆ Summons forth the Jinni within the lamp, that connects to a nearby character. The connected character will continuously restore HP based on Dori's Max HP, and will continuously regenerate Energy.

III. New Domains

Domain of Forgery: Tower of Abject Pride

◇ It is said that the deserts were once home to three sage-kings, one of whom remained lovely and wise till the very end. They parted ways eventually for the sake of the paradise they sought in their hearts. This place is called a "tower," but in truth was the temporary residence of one of these people when they were building that earthly paradise. If one stretches the past back even further, it was once a small shrine built to avoid the wind and the sand.

◇ Unlock Criteria:

• Reach Adventure Rank 22 or above

• Or complete the Archon Quest Prologue: Act II "For a Tomorrow Without Tears"

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain Weapon Ascension Materials.

Domain of Mastery: Steeple of Ignorance

◇ In the ancient past, man-made towers that could touch the skies were built all across the land. Though human hearts flowed downward, their souls aspired toward the high heavens. These towers would always fall, or collapse under their own weight and plummet into the depths. However, if one were to look at things at a grander scale, the heavens and earth are as one — no direction is truly different from another.

◇ Unlock Criteria:

• Reach Adventure Rank 22 or above

• Or complete the Archon Quest Chapter I: Act I "Of the Land Amidst Monoliths"

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain Talent Level-Up Materials.

Domain of Blessing: Spire of Solitary Enlightenment

◇ In ancient times, this was a great and beautiful place, seemingly made to bless the children of humanity. But the arrow of heaven would descend, making mountains out of flat land and burying the ancient capitol beneath the hills.

◇ Unlock Criteria:

• Reach Adventure Rank 22 or above

• Or complete the Archon Quest "Prologue: Act III - Song of the Dragon and Freedom"

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain artifacts in the "Deepwood Memories" and "Gilded Dreams" sets.

Domain: Under the Umbrella's Shade

◇ The poets have it that spores, like trees, are connected to each other, and that all fungal beings in the world share a single dream. At the end of that dream, the spores would take on the forms of all things, and that all things would return to the beginning — return to being one — and that there would never again be boundaries. But the evolution of Fungi into sentient, locomotive beings was not something that happened in such primordial times. Regardless, this place has become fertile soil for Fungi to thrive.

◇ Unlock Criteria: Reach Adventure Rank 20 or above and fulfill certain criteria.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems, Dendro Sigils, and more.

Domain: Fragment of Childhood Dreams

◇ This was once a dreamland paradise of a child of the forest, constructed based on how other children would describe the woods. In their memories, the forest was incredibly vast, much like the world itself. The forest was also immensely deep, just like fate itself. Although the dimensions of the world and the true depth of destiny would ultimately disappoint, the fantasy of them endures deep within this nursery.

◇ Unlock Criteria: Reach Adventure Rank 24 or above and fulfill certain criteria.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems, Dendro Sigils, and more.

Domain: The Dark Valley

◇ Legend has it that the moon once had a face. Under the fierce moon's face, like a white bow, the paths through the forest labyrinth would bring lost people to jade and amber dreams. This forest labyrinth has ceased to exist for hundreds of years — and yet even a hundred thousand winters must seem like a day in the garden of dreams.

◇ Unlock Criteria: Reach Adventure Rank 28 or above and fulfill certain criteria.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems, Dendro Sigils, and more.

Domain: The Coordinates of Sun and Rain

◇ According to the legends, the goddess who had command over plants would summon forth a spirit of timely rains, whose name was Varuna, or "water and sky." These same legends say that the now-deceased forest king used hedges and streams, and the children of the pomegranate used dreams and illusions to create a labyrinth as deep and intricate as the very roots of trees themselves, to defend the secret of sun and rain.

◇ Unlock Criteria: Reach Adventure Rank 32 or above and fulfill certain criteria.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems, Dendro Sigils, and more.
