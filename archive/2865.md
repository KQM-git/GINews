Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

After reading Notices, the red notification dot may still be displayed. Travelers who encounter this situation can exit from the Paimon Menu and close the game before logging back in to temporarily resolve the issue.

When carrying out the objective "Go to where the tea master is" in the Story Quest "Cleansing Light," there is a chance whereby the quest is unable to progress after reaching the destination point. Travelers who experience this issue can exit the game via the Paimon Menu before logging in again as a temporary fix.

There is an issue whereby the voice line for Yae Miko's Profile > Voice-Over "More About Yae Miko: IV" cannot be played. This issue will be fixed in a future version.

After updating the official driver released by Razer on January 20, some Travelers using Razer devices on PC may experience a crash error when logging in to the game. Travelers who encounter this problem can try to uninstall the Razer driver first and restart the computer as a temporary fix. If the issue persists, please contact us via the email Genshin_cs@hoyoverse.com.
