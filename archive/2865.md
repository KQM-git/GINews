Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

After reading Notices, the red notification dot may still be displayed. Travelers who encounter this situation can exit from the Paimon Menu and close the game before logging back in to temporarily resolve the issue.

When carrying out the objective "Go to where the tea master is" in the Story Quest "Cleansing Light," there is a chance whereby the quest is unable to progress after reaching the destination point. Travelers who experience this issue can exit the game via the Paimon Menu before logging in again as a temporary fix.

There is an issue whereby the voice line for Yae Miko's Profile > Voice-Over "More About Yae Miko: IV" cannot be played. This issue will be fixed in a future version.

After updating the official driver released by Razer on January 20, some Travelers using Razer devices on PC may experience a crash error when logging in to the game. Travelers who encounter this problem can try to uninstall the Razer driver first and restart the computer as a temporary fix. If the issue persists, please contact us via the email Genshin_cs@hoyoverse.com.

Optimizes an issue whereby there was a small probability that the frame rate would drop abnormally for some PC users.

Fixes an issue under certain circumstances during the "Three Realms Gateway Offering" event whereby the mechanism in the Evernight Temple area would not activate correctly if the monsters were defeated prematurely.

Fixes an issue in the Daily Commission "Adventurer Exam: The Art of Adventure" whereby the quest could not be continued if the Traveler was disconnected while gathering quest items.

Fixes a translation error in English, German, French, Spanish, Indonesian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Thai, and Vietnamese during a line of dialogue in the Story Quest "Radiant Sakura". At the same time, in order to avoid misunderstanding caused by the inconsistency between the voice-over and the changed text, the corresponding English and Japanese audio files have been removed temporarily.

The erroneous portion of the original text reads: "I know what you mean. Perhaps Makoto got a higher power involved in all of this. But whatever the explanation, her solution is what saved us all."

The revised text reads: "I know what you mean. Perhaps a higher power really was involved in all of this. But whatever the explanation, her solution is what saved us all."

Fixes an issue whereby the quest objective "Assemble the Tower of the Void" in the event "Three Realms Gateway Offering" may be impossible to complete.

Fixes an issue whereby there is a small chance that the dark fog in the "Three Realms Gateway Offering" area could not be dispelled after using the gadget "Bokuso Box."
