Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

- There is an issue whereby after the Version 4.7 update, Neuvillette's Charged Attack "Equitable Judgment" is more likely to be obstructed by certain terrain or Stone Steles under specific circumstances in comparison to previous versions. Our developers are working hard to fix this issue, please stay tuned to future announcements.

- There is an issue under certain circumstances whereby Travelers using controllers with iOS devices will encounter issues of corresponding skill icons not displaying for the bumper button and trigger button (taking the XBOX wireless controller as an example, corresponding to the RB and RT buttons), and the buttons not working when pressed.

Travelers who encounter this issue can try to restore the default controller button settings through the "Settings/Controls" interface as a temporary fix to the issue. Travelers can reset the button control settings as needed subsequently. If the issue persists, please contact Customer Service to provide feedback.

- There is an issue whereby testing voice-over resources were incorrectly used for some of Sethos's Chinese voice-overs in the cutscene animation of Cyno's Story Quest Lupus Aureus Chapter: Act II "Oathkeeper." This resource was not recorded by Chinese voice actor 李兰陵 Lanling Li.

This issue will be fixed in Version 4.8.
