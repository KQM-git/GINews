Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

- There is an issue whereby the character Sigewinne would not be displayed on the Character Archive interface. This character will be displayed correctly after 2024/06/26 18:00 (Server Time).

- There is an issue whereby testing voice-over resources were incorrectly used for some of Sethos's Chinese voice-overs in the cutscene animation of Cyno's Story Quest Lupus Aureus Chapter: Act II "Oathkeeper." This resource was not recorded by Chinese voice actor 李兰陵 Lanling Li.

This issue will be fixed in Version 4.8.

- Fixes an issue whereby enemies in some areas or quests (e.g. in the Tunigi Hollow, or the enemy "Arakawa Kouji" in Yae Miko's Story Quest) have a probability of abnormally leaving combat and recovering HP, and are unable to be defeated after the Version 4.7 update.

Travelers affected by the above issue can log out via the Paimon Menu and close the game, then log in again to continue the game as normal.

- The fix for "the issue whereby the sorting of Artifacts in the 'Inventory > Artifacts' interface would appear incorrectly under certain circumstances after the Version 4.7 update" carried out on June 13 has resulted in abnormal lags for the Artifacts Batch Destroy function, and has thus been rolled back. This issue will be fixed in Version 4.8.

- Fixes an issue in "Genius Invokation TCG" whereby after the summon "Singer of Many Waters" of the character card "Furina" switches state to "Salon Members," the effects of other summons would be incorrectly evaluated during the end of turn under certain circumstances.

- Fixes an issue whereby the actual Render Resolution of some Android devices with low memory was lower than expected, resulting in blurry graphics after the Version 4.7 update.

- Fixes an issue whereby the number of "resonances" triggered was abnormal when using Geo constructs to resonate with the "Unique Rock Pillars" after the Version 4.7 update.

Travelers affected by the above issues can log out via the Paimon Menu and close the game client, then log in again to continue the game as normal.
