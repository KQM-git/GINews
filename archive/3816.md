Every Droplet he absorbs will increase the charging speed and will heal Neuvillette. When the charging is complete, then a Charged Attack: Equitable Judgment will be unleashed, dealing continuous AoE Hydro DMG to all opponents in a straight-line area in front of him. If Neuvillette's HP is above 50%, he will continuously lose HP while using this attack.
