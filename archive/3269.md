Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

There is an issue in Co-Op Mode whereby when multiple Cyno characters cast their Elemental Burst, the display of Endseer's special effect might be displayed abnormally (the actual effects of the skill work as intended in-game). This issue will be fixed in a later update, please stay tuned for future notices.

There is an issue whereby there is a brief period of abnormal brightness changes in the game when some characters enter Aiming Mode or after casting their Elemental Burst. This issue will be fixed in a later update, please stay tuned for future notices.

Currently, there is an issue of abnormal color display in some features (such as meteorites summoned by the Geo Traveler's Elemental Skill, Paimon's cloak, Elemental Sight, etc.) in areas affected by "The Withering." This issue will be fixed in a future version.

〓Update Content 2022/09/30 14:25:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue under certain conditions whereby Travelers could not open the corresponding treasure chest after arriving at the location indicated by the 13th landscape painting in the Mysterious Clipboard of the gadget "Aranyaka." Travelers who encounter this issue can log out through the Paimon Menu and log in again to resolve it.

Fixes an issue whereby when carrying out the quest objective "Pass the three trials" in the World Quest "Golden Slumber: Dreams Beneath the Searing Sand," the quest could not continue as the Neverlight Cells would have a small probability of being abnormal, resulting in a failure to open the door. Travelers who encounter this issue can continue to solve the puzzle mechanism after logging in again.

Fixes an issue with a treasure chest near Dar al-Shifa in the Land of Lower Setekh area whereby after defeating the nearby enemy, if the player does not open the chest before the end of the day, they will be unable to unlock the chest the following day.

〓Update Content 2022/09/29 16:05:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue whereby when the character Cyno is under the "Pactsworn Pathclearer" state, after unleashing his Elemental Burst again, there is a small probability that the Elemental Burst would not take effect properly.
