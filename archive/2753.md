As news of the Jade Chamber's reconstruction spreads, many merchants flock to Yujing Terrace.

Ningguang's reward raises the curtain on the competition, while dark undercurrents present a different sort of threat.

Will Liyue, now under human rule, withstand the coming tide? Will the one long separated from society find their place among people once more?

All will be revealed when the Jade Chamber rises once more.
