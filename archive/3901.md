Dear Travelers,

Genshin Impact Version 4.2 is here, with new areas and characters from Fontaine waiting for you! Genshin Impact's tools in HoYoLab have also been updated with a load of new content to help you on your journey through Version 4.2. Let's take a look~

| Teyvat Interactive Map Update: Adds the new areas in Fontaine as well as route update notices.

2 new areas become available in Version 4.2: Morte Region and Erinnyes Forest. Pins and other information for said areas will also be added to the Interactive Map.

Related explanations for updated pins and routes will also be added to the notices section of the Interactive Map to help keep Travelers informed about updates.
