- Fixes an issue under certain circumstances whereby when collecting local specialties in marked map areas, the indicator circle data did not update and the indicator circle continued to mark the map after collecting the local specialty in the corresponding area.

- Fixes an issue under certain circumstances whereby players were unable to talk to the NPC "Orqo" after collecting all the required quest items.

- Fixes a text error in Traditional Chinese in the "Hmm? Natlan?" Commission Quest description.

- Fixes an issue under certain circumstances whereby a "Monetoo" in the "Natlan" and "Teticpac Peak" areas could not move properly, preventing the completion of related puzzle gameplay.

- Fixes an issue whereby some scene objects would abnormally disappear on some Android devices with Mali G57 GPUs.

- Improves an issue whereby the achievement "Polychrome Tri-Stars" could not be completed. Travelers who encountered this issue can achieve the accomplishment by re-completing the relevant challenges after the fix. If the issue persists, Travelers can report the issue through the Feedback tab in the Paimon Menu.

Currently, there is still a small chance that the achievement "Polychrome Tri-Stars" may not be completed in Co-Op Mode under certain circumstances. This issue will be fully resolved in a future update.

Travelers affected by the above issues can log out via the Paimon Menu and close the game, then log in again to resolve the issues.
