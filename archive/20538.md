Dear Travelers,

Our developers are expected to begin performing update maintenance at 2024/06/05 06:00:00 (global). Please stay tuned to related game update information.

In this update, the logic of some game files on PC have been adjusted, meaning that the pre-installation and update process on PC will require a large amount of space.

Compared to the size of the pre-installation package, after the update, the overall package size of the game is not expected to increase significantly compared to Version 4.6.

We recommend that you save sufficient space on your device and complete this download over a Wi-Fi connection.

During the pre-installation and installation process, the storage space required for unzipping on PC will be between 20–28 GB. The size of the pre-installation resource package will be between 19–25 GB.

After the version update, the total file size on PC is estimated to increase by 2–4 GB compared to Version 4.6.

Regardless of whether you complete pre-installation, any content you download in advance will increase the download speed during the version update.
