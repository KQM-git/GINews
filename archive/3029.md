Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

Continuous attacks have a very low probability of abnormally and significantly extending the duration of various effects on the character Kamisato Ayato (up to twice the duration), including but not limited to the "Takimeguri Kanka" state from his Elemental Skill, "Corrosion", and "Smoldering Flames" that are applied to the character.

The developers have detected the initial cause of this issue. As the fix involves fundamental logic, this issue will be fixed in Version 3.0 after comprehensive testing.

*Note: The fix will not affect the abnormal increase in duration caused by hit lag, or Plunging Attacks that can be performed from jumping on a flat surface due to hit lag.

When using an iOS or Android device to play the game, after some characters cast their Elemental Bursts, there may be a problem with their weapons' color display. This issue will be fixed in a later version update. Please stay tuned for future notices.

There is an issue whereby after the Version 2.7 update, the special effects of Childe's Talent "Riptide Burst" would display abnormally (actual combat effects are not affected). This issue will be fixed in the update on June 9. After the fix, the effect performance will be the same as before the Version 2.7 update.

There is an issue with the Archon Quest "Danger All Around" whereby Travelers may not be able to control their characters if they reconnect to the server during a conversation when carrying out the quest objective "Examine the mysterious door in front of you."

This issue will be fixed in a later update, please stay tuned for future notices. Travelers who encounter this issue can exit the game by closing the game client and wait for five minutes before entering the Domain again to continue the quest. Please ensure that your network is in good condition during the quest, or re-enter the Domain to continue the quest after the issue is fixed.

Fixes an issue whereby the "Events Overview" and "Mail" pages would display abnormally or freeze when playing on a PC with the system regional format set to Arabic, or on a PS5™ or PS4™ console with the system language set to Arabic.

Travelers affected by these issues can restart the game to continue playing normally.

Fixes an issue whereby during the "Perilous Trail" event, the Adventure Rank requirement of the Archon Quest "Perilous Trail" was incorrectly configured as AR 40 and above. After this fix, the Adventure Rank required to start the quest will be AR 28 and above.

▌Issue Fix Compensation
