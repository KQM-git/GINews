Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

Continuous attacks have a very low probability of abnormally and significantly extending the duration of various effects on the character Kamisato Ayato (up to twice the duration), including but not limited to the "Takimeguri Kanka" state from his Elemental Skill, "Corrosion", and "Smoldering Flames" that are applied to the character.

The developers have detected the initial cause of this issue. As the fix involves fundamental logic, this issue will be fixed in Version 3.0 after comprehensive testing.

*Note: The fix will not affect the abnormal increase in duration caused by hit lag, or Plunging Attacks that can be performed from jumping on a flat surface due to hit lag.

When using an iOS or Android device to play the game, after some characters cast their Elemental Bursts, there may be a problem with their weapons' color display. This issue will be fixed in a later version update. Please stay tuned for future notices.

There is an issue whereby after the Version 2.7 update, the special effects of Childe's Talent "Riptide Burst" would display abnormally (actual combat effects are not affected). This issue will be fixed in the update on June 9. After the fix, the effect performance will be the same as before the Version 2.7 update.

There is an issue whereby after the Version 2.7 update, the Wolf Within special effects of Razor's idle animation and Elemental Burst would display abnormally (actual combat effects are not affected). This issue will be fixed in the update on June 9. After the fix, the effect performance will be the same as before the Version 2.7 update.

There is an issue whereby the quest item "Archaic Stone" from the Story Quest "No Mere Stone" would disappear abnormally after completing the World Quest "The Tales Behind the Fan." The disappearance of this item will not affect the progress and completion of any relevant quest, and Travelers can continue the quest as normal. This issue will be fixed in the Version 2.8 update and the missing item will be restored after the fix.

Fixes an issue with the Story Quest "Candidature Analysis" whereby there is a small chance that some Places of Interest disappeared when carrying out the quest objective "Investigate the abandoned camp," causing the quest objective to be unable to be completed.

Fixes an issue whereby when there are emails in some languages (such as Thai) in the Mailbox, even if the number of the emails have not reached the limit, the message "Some mail is not displayed" may appear on the mail opening interface, and some emails in the Gift Mail Box will not be displayed normally. Travelers who encounter this problem do not need to delete their in-game mail; other than Gift Mail Box, other mail functions can still be used normally.

〓Update Content 2022/06/03 10:35:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue whereby the "Abyssal Moon Spire - Summary" and "Challenge Summary" pages in the game would freeze when playing on a PC with the system regional format set to Arabic, or on a PS5™ or PS4™ console with the system language set to Arabic.

〓Update Content 2022/06/01 14:40:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue with the Archon Quest "Danger All Around" whereby Travelers may not be able to control their characters if they reconnect to the server during a conversation when carrying out the quest objective "Examine the mysterious door in front of you."

Travelers who encounter this issue can enter the Domain again to continue the quest.

〓Update Content 2022/06/01 02:00:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue whereby the "Events Overview" and "Mail" pages would display abnormally or freeze when playing on a PC with the system regional format set to Arabic, or on a PS5™ or PS4™ console with the system language set to Arabic.

Travelers affected by these issues can restart the game to continue playing normally.

〓Update Content 2022/05/31 20:18:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue whereby during the "Perilous Trail" event, the Adventure Rank requirement of the Archon Quest "Perilous Trail" was incorrectly configured as AR 40 and above. After this fix, the Adventure Rank required to start the quest will be AR 28 and above.
