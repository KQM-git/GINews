Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Update Content 2022/11/02 21:30:00 (global)〓

Fixes an issue whereby when playing on PC, PS4™, and PS5™, the Artifacts icon would appear blurry on the "Characters > Artifacts" interface.

Fixes an issue whereby, under certain circumstances, when carrying out the objective "Talk to Candace" in the Archon Quest "Through the Predawn Night," there is a small probability that the quest icon would be abnormally located in Liyue.

Travelers affected by the issues mentioned above can restart the game to continue playing normally.
