Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

Currently, Travelers who have accomplished the Achievement "Justice Falling" will fail to accomplish the Achievement "Active Camouflage." This issue will be fixed in a later update. Please stay tuned for future notices.

In order to accommodate the configuration needs of different Travelers, we will restore the PC version's SMAA Anti-Aliasing option in a later update. After the update, the Anti-Aliasing options of the PC version will be adjusted to: "None," "FSR 2," and "SMAA." Please stay tuned for future notices.
