Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

There is an issue whereby some Travelers might experience game client crashes when playing Genius Invokation TCG on Huawei devices. Travelers experiencing this issue can go to Settings > About phone > Parameter version, tap on the gear-shaped button in the top-right corner of the page, and enable "Auto-update parameters."

When "Device optimization GT.GENC.1.17.22.101" is indicated on the Settings > About phone > Parameter version page, it means the update is successful.

Travelers can resolve the crashing issue with this update. If the issue persists, Travelers can report the issue through the Feedback tab in the Paimon Menu.

There is an issue whereby under certain circumstances, after the Wanderer casts his Elemental Skill, there is a small chance that he would remain in the hovering state abnormally. This issue will be fixed in a later update, please stay tuned for future notices.
