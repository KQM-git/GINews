There is an issue whereby some Travelers might experience game client crashes when playing Genius Invokation TCG on Huawei devices. Travelers experiencing this issue can go to Settings > About phone > Parameter version, tap on the gear-shaped button in the top-right corner of the page, and enable "Auto-update parameters."

When "Device optimization GT.GENC.1.17.22.101" is indicated on the Settings > About phone > Parameter version page, it means the update is successful.

Travelers can resolve the crashing issue with this update. If the issue persists, Travelers can report the issue through the Feedback tab in the Paimon Menu.

There is an issue whereby under certain circumstances, the Request "Hilichurl Hullaballoo" from Inazuman NPC Furuya Noboru will disappear abnormally from the Quest Menu or cannot be accepted from the Reputation interface.

In the following week, we will provide the following compensation to Travelers who have encountered this issue and have not reached Reputation Level 10 in Inazuma: Inazuma's Reputation EXP ×40.

There is an issue whereby there is an error in the reward for Faruzan's trial in the Test Run event. Henna Berries should be rewarded instead of Scarabs. We will issue Henna Berries ×3 to affected Travelers.
