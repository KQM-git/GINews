Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

There is an issue whereby some Travelers might experience game client crashes when playing Genius Invokation TCG on Huawei devices. Travelers experiencing this issue can attempt to adjust their graphics settings to Low via the Paimon Menu > Settings > Graphics as a temporary fix. If the issue persists, Travelers can report the issue through the Feedback tab in the Paimon Menu.

There is an issue whereby under certain circumstances, the Request "Hilichurl Hullaballoo" from Inazuman NPC Furuya Noboru will disappear abnormally from the Quest Menu or cannot be accepted from the Reputation interface. Travelers who encounter this issue can accept Requests from other areas this week. In the following week, we will provide the following compensation to Travelers who have encountered this issue and have not reached Reputation Level 10 in Inazuma: Inazuma's Reputation EXP ×40.

There is an issue whereby the BP-exclusive Furnishing Blueprint "Light of the Land of Wisdom" can be purchased from the Teapot Spirit, Tubby. In Version 3.4, we will issue the following compensation to Travelers who have unlocked Version 3.3's Gnostic Chorus: a brand-new BP-exclusive Furnishing Blueprint. More details regarding this compensation and how it will be issued will follow in future notices.

There is an issue whereby there is an error in the reward for Faruzan's trial in the Test Run event. Henna Berries should be rewarded instead of Scarabs. We will issue Henna Berries ×3 to affected Travelers.
