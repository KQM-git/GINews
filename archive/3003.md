Dear Travelers,

Version 2.7 update maintenance is expected to start at 2022/05/31 06:00:00 (global) and is expected to be completed within 5 hours. Meanwhile, the duration of Version 2.7 is expected to be 6 weeks, and Version 2.8 is expected to be updated on 2022/07/13.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by this delay.

The current Character Event Wish, Weapon Event Wish and "Test Run" event will end on 2022/05/31 05:59:59 (global). The countdown time display on the Wish screen and Events Overview page will also be adjusted. There are no changes to the end times of other in-game events.

Maintenance for the Placement Function in the Serenitea Pot will also end after the Version 2.7 update maintenance is complete. Travelers can then resume using this Placement Function.

Once again, we apologize for the delay in this update. Thank you for your continued support and understanding.
