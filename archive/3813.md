**〓Event Details〓**

● After the start of the event, a new challenge will become available each day. Each challenge will include 3 battle stages.

● You will be provided with two trial characters during each challenge. The more of your own characters in your party, and the higher level they are, the more Load you will have to exchange and the higher level Buff Modules you will be able to equip.

● During the challenge, using Pressurized Impactors will provide enormous assistance, enabling you to activate Buff Modules and release "high-pressure shockwaves."

● You must charge the Pressurized Impactors before you can release high-pressure shockwaves. Charging requires increasing the pressure 3 times. Use the right timing to stop the pressure increases within proper range to successfully charge.

● Note that high-pressure shockwave damage is affected by the charging results.
