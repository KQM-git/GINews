Dear Traveler

Due to a configuration issue with the in-game mail, some Travelers received two copies of the mail "Flowing Lights and Colors" - Lantern Rite Gifts (1/5).

Between 2022/02/09 03:00:00 (global) and the end of V2.4, all Travelers will receive a total of two copies of the mail "Flowing Lights and Colors" - Lantern Rite Gifts (1/5). Travelers who have already received two copies will not be able to claim further rewards. We will not withdraw any rewards already issued.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.
