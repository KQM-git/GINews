Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

There is an issue in Genius Invokation TCG whereby the Summon "Ushi" summoned by the Character Card "Arataki Itto" has an abnormal effect. When the current Active Character switches to another Character due to DMG taken from a certain skill effect and the Character that is switched in does not receive DMG from said skill effect, Ushi is unable to apply the Superlative Superstrength status to Arataki Itto.

In future versions, this effect will be changed to: When your character receives DMG, Arataki Itto gains Superlative Superstrength.

There is an issue under certain circumstances whereby Hydro applications on characters or enemies cannot be removed normally. Travelers who experience this issue can exit the game via the Paimon Menu before logging in again as a temporary fix. This issue will be fixed in a future version. Please stay tuned for future notices.
