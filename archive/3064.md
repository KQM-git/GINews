Travelers can confirm the challenge objectives for each challenge on the Score Details page in Challenge Details.

● The Raid challenge requires Travelers to navigate your Waverider to reach a certain sea region, board floating platforms, and defeat all opponents on them within a time limit to complete the challenge.
