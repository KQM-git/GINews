〓Event Details〓

● During "Moonlit Patrol Exercise," you will need to select a Frontline Captain and combat units, creating a lineup to deploy against the opposing formation. At the start of each Wargame, you will select a Frontline Captain. During each round, you will select a certain number of combat units and stratagems, and then fight a simulated wargame with a designated opponent.

● The simulation ends after completing 10 rounds or losing 4 rounds. If you win at least 7 rounds when the simulation concludes, you will enter Endless Wargame. After all simulations are finished, you will earn "Wargame Points" based on the number of your wins and overall performance.

● "Wargame Points" have a cap. When the event begins, the cap is 2,000. The cap will increase starting the fourth day of the event, up to a maximum of 4,000.
