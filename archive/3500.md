**〓Event Details〓**

● A new seasoning recipe will unlock on each of the first 7 days of the event. Follow the recipes to create "Fragrant Seasonings" and obtain corresponding rewards.

● Add the Fragrant Seasonings to Delicious dishes to obtain Fragrant dishes. You can invite characters to taste-test the Fragrant Dishes in your Serenitea Pot to increase their Companionship EXP and also hear their responses, which will vary based on the character's personal preferences. There is a limit on the number of times you can get Companionship EXP during the event.

● During the event, you can invite Paimon to your Serenitea Pot to sample your dishes. Inviting Paimon to sample your dishes will not increase Companionship EXP, but also will not consume from the limited number of times you can get Companionship EXP.

● Reach Adventure Rank 28 and complete the "A Teapot to Call Home" quest to unlock the Serenitea Pot. You can accept the "Idle Teapot Talk" quest from Tubby in the Serenitea Pot. After completing the quest and obtaining "Realm Dispatch," you can invite characters to your Serenitea Pot to sample your dishes.

※ After 2023/04/10 03:59:59 (server), "Fragrant Seasonings" and "Fragrant Dishes" will be removed from your Inventory.
