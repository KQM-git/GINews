● Sojourner's Battle Pass will be unlocked by default every BP Period. Travelers can also unlock either Gnostic Hymn or Gnostic Chorus in order to earn even more rewards, or directly purchase Gnostic Chorus at a discounted price.

● Starting from this Battle Pass, on top of the five 4-star weapons already in the BP Bounty, the following new 4-star weapons will also be available: Wolf-Fang (Sword), Talking Stick (Claymore), Sacrificial Jade (Catalyst), Scion of the Blazing Sun (Bow), and Ballad of the Fjords (Polearm). Reach Gnostic Hymn Level 30 to select any one of these ten weapons from the BP Bounty.

● Starting from this Battle Pass, the Talent Level-Up Material bundles "Guidance of the Land of Thunder" will be replaced with "Guide to the Original Current," and "Philosophies of the Land of Thunder" will be replaced with "Philosophies of the Original Current."

※ Travelers who have already unlocked Gnostic Hymn need only exchange the remaining difference in cost through purchasing Travel Notes in order to unlock Gnostic Chorus.

※ The purchasing of Gnostic Hymn, Gnostic Chorus, and Travel Notes for this Battle Pass will end on 2023/09/25 02:59:59 (server). Travelers can still complete Battle Pass Missions and claim rewards after the purchase period ends. Travelers, please take note of the purchase period and start time of the Battle Pass.
