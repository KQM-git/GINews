Adventure Rank 28 or above

Complete the "Surreptitious Seven-Star Seal Sundering" World Quest to unlock the Underground Mines of The Chasm.

Obtain the Lumenstone Adjuvant in the World Quest "Chasm Spelunkers" and upgrade it to Level 2.

**〓Event Details〓**

● From the first day of the event, the corresponding quests will be unlocked every day. The newly unlocked quest cannot be picked up until the previous day's quest has been completed.

● During the cleanup, the dangerous dark mud that continues to ooze out will buff nearby monsters, increasing their ATK and DEF greatly. When these monsters are in areas covered by the dark mud, their abilities will be further increased.

● Monsters will constantly interfere with your cleanup work and the surrounding area will flood over with dark mud. Equip the Lumenstone Adjuvant and use the Blooming Light to clear the dark mud and weaken the monsters to further the cleaning process.

● As you continue to clean, the difficulty of cleaning dark mud will gradually increase. Travelers can search for more Lumenspar in The Chasm: Underground Mines, and strengthen the Lumenstone Adjuvant to a higher level.
