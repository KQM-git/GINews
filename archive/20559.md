● After the event begins, 2 new stages will be unlocked every day for the first 4 days. There are a total of 8 stages.

● After starting the stage, activate the water cannon with a most peculiar appearance and hit the floating targets to complete timed shooting challenges.

● When the watercannon fires, it will consume its Energy Reserve. The Energy Reserve is slowly replenished over time, but it can also be restored by hitting EZ-Charge Balls.

● In this event, the "Improved Crococannon" is equipped with two different firing modes, and these modes can be used to handle different kinds of Target Ball setups.
