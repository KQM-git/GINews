Dear Traveler,

The payment system for Genshin Impact's PC and web Top-Up Center will undergo maintenance starting at 07:00 (UTC+8) on September 10, 2024. The maintenance is expected to last for about half an hour, but the actual end time may be adjusted based on the circumstances.

During the maintenance period, Travelers will be unable to purchase in-game items. Travelers who fail to make a purchase during this time can log back into the game after maintenance ends to reclaim the items.

We would like to express our utmost apologies for any inconvenience caused. Thank you for your patience and understanding.
