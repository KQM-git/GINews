〓Event Details〓

● After the event begins, a total of 8 stages in the "Free & Easy Fun" mode and 7 stages in the "Hardly Even Hardball" mode will unlock over the course of the first 4 days.

● In the "Free & Easy Fun" mode, some stages will have Rival Finchballs in them. You must accurately launch Finchballs to knock Rival Finchballs out of the scoring area. When some stages start, the field will have friendly Normal Finchballs. You must accurately launch Finchballs so that more of them can land in the scoring area to score more points.

● In the "Hardly Even Hardball" mode, two players will square off against one another, taking turns to launch Finchballs. After the final round ends, the winner will be decided by tabulating the scores of the landing spots of each Finchball.

● After the event begins, the maximum number of Glittering Finch Coins obtainable will be increased by 500 for the first 4 days. Playing either the "Free & Easy Fun" mode or the "Hardly Even Hardball" mode will grant Glittering Finch Coins. Accumulate a certain number of Glittering Finch Coins to obtain the corresponding rewards.
