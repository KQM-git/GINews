Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

There is an issue whereby there is a small probability that the character model being controlled will disappear under certain circumstances when Travelers on mobile devices play through Lynette's Hangout Event.

Travelers who encounter this problem can log out of the game and log in again as a temporary fix. If the issue persists or other issues occur, Travelers can report the issue through the Feedback tab in the Paimon Menu.
