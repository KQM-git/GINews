Dear Travelers,

Our developers are expected to begin performing update maintenance at 2023/08/16 06:00:00 (global). Please stay tuned to related game update information.

In Version 4.0, some game files have been adjusted to optimize the gaming experience, meaning that this update will require a large amount of space.

We recommend that you save sufficient space on your device and complete this pre-installation over a Wi-Fi connection.

The pre-installation resource package size for PCs will be between 32.0 – 34.2 GB, and the space required for unzipping will be 64.0 - 68.4 GB. The pre-installation resource package size for mobile devices will be between 8.1 – 10.8 GB (the voice-over files installed will affect the size of the space required for pre-installation).

Regardless of whether you complete pre-installation, any content you download in advance will increase the download speed during the version update.
