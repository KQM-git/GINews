Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

- There is an issue under specific circumstances whereby certain characters' voice lines will be abnormally triggered when moving around in the water (such as Opening Treasure Chest voice lines). This issue will be fixed in a future version update. Please stay tuned for future notices.

- There is an issue with Lyney's Elemental Burst icon and the fireworks ignited when the Grin-Malkin Cat generated by the Elemental Burst is canceled actively or its duration ends whereby the position of its teardrop is indicated wrongly. This issue is scheduled to be fixed in Version 4.1.

- There is an issue whereby when carrying out the World Quests "Capturing Light and Shadow" or "Returning Curios" in Co-Op Mode, the host is unable to obtain the Mora treasure chest related to the "Choo-Choo Cart" gameplay under specific circumstances. We will issue the treasure chest reward via an in-game mail to all affected Travelers after the end of Version 3.8.

Optimizes the issue whereby under specific circumstances, when characters take the elevator at the Romaritime Harbor or other regions in Fontaine, they might encounter an issue of falling abnormally and hovering persistently in the air. If Travelers still encounter the issue of falling abnormally, please wait for your character to land at the bottom, then take the elevator again.
