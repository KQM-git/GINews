**〓Event Details〓**

● On each of the 6 days of the event after it has begun, the maximum number of Windtrace Coins you can collect is increased by 1,000. Travelers can obtain Windtrace Coins or complete Strategic Challenges to claim the corresponding rewards.

● A new mechanism "Signaling Device" has been added to this edition of Windtrace. Rebels must repair these devices while avoiding the Hunter's pursuit, while the Hunter must stop the Rebels from repairing these devices, or simply eliminate all the Rebels.

● The first time each Rebel is captured by a Hunter, they will be detained within a "Surveillance Zone" for a while. They will be released automatically once the time of imprisonment ends. Other Rebels can also approach the Surveillance Zone and help their imprisoned comrade escape. When a Rebel who has been imprisoned before is once again captured, that Rebel will be eliminated from the match.

● The Rebels will win if they repair 4 Signaling Devices within the time limit. If they fail to do so, the Hunter will be victorious. If no Rebels on the field can operate freely, e.g. all the Rebels have been captured or eliminated, the Hunter will be earn an early victory.

※ In "Windtrace: Seekers and Strategy," you can earn Windtrace Coins in Solo Mode and matchmade games alongside up to 2 friends. When forming a custom Co-Op party with 3 other friends to play this game or when your Windtrace Coins have reached the current maximum, you will not obtain any Windtrace Coins.
