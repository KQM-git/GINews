I. Limited-Time Area: Veluriyam Mirage (This area is only available during Version 3.8)

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Veluriyam Mirage</span></summary>

This is a story that takes place within the confines of a little glass bottle. Rumor tells of a mysterious domain in the center of the desert, and it is said that those who enter shall be granted their heart's desire.

But who is to say whether there is any truth in this? Who knows if the fervor of countless travelers, filling this world inside a bottle to the very brim, is nothing but a mirage?

◇ Area Unlock Criteria:

• Adventure Rank 18 or above

• Complete the Archon Quest "Song of the Dragon and Freedom"

(Complete Archon Quest Chapter III: Act V "Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises," Eula's Story Quest "Aphros Delos Chapter: Act I," and Sangonomiya Kokomi's Story Quest "Dracaena Somnolenta Chapter: Act I" first to get the best experience from this event.)

◆ The Veluriyam Mirage will no longer be accessible after the end of Version 3.8. You will also no longer be able to open treasure chests, gather materials, or earn quest rewards within the Veluriyam Mirage, so grab the opportunity to explore away!

◆ In Co-Op Mode, the areas within the Veluriyam Mirage that each Traveler has access to will depend on their progress in the game.

II. New Outfits

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Klee - "Blossoming Starlight"</span></summary>

◇ An exquisite outfit Klee wears only for the most important performances. The colors are brilliant, like a cake adorned with cream flowers and crowned with scarlet candles. With it comes happiness and smiles that will fill your adventures.

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Kaeya - "Sailwind Shadow"</span></summary>

◆ After Version 3.8 is over, Travelers can buy the outfit in the Character Outfit Shop.

"Travel Notes: Vivid Illumination": Reward obtained via the BP system

- Adds some prompts for loading screens.

- Adds Set 24 of "Paimon's Paintings" chat emojis.

- Adds link in the Source section of "Dust of Azoth" for the Stardust Exchange page.

- New Furnishing: "Leisure Device: Twang-Bang-Bang"

A combination device designed with great care by Tubby, using both the Scoreboard and Boom-Boom Barrels. By interacting with the Scoreboard, a timed shooting game will begin, or previous scores can be viewed. Before beginning the game, the locations of the Boom-Boom Barrels can be freely adjusted.

Though the Traveler is not an especially gifted archer, Tubby has heard that among the guests invited to The Realm Within, there are archers that can "pierce a pot from a hundred paces." Guests like this would surely like to practice their skills, and further hone their accuracy. And so, a mechanism that can be combined with all kinds of various furnishings to create unique and exciting challenges was born...

- "Genius Invokation TCG" Gameplay Update:

New Character Cards: Yanfei, Kaedehara Kazuha, and Candace, and their corresponding Talent cards.

New invitation duels and guest challenges added to the Player List.

New Action Cards: Fruit of Fulfillment, Master Zhang, Rhythm of the Great Dream, Ancient Courtyard, and Covenant of Rock.

Adds new Action Card type "Arcane Legend" and related rules:

(1) You can only have one of each identical Arcane Legend card in your deck.

(2) Your starting hand will contain an Arcane Legend card from your deck.

(3) Each player may only play one Arcane Legend card for the entire game.

- Spiral Abyss

Floor 11 Ley Line Disorder changed to:

• All party members receive a 75% Physical DMG Bonus.

Updated the monster lineup on Floor 11 of the Spiral Abyss.

Updated the monster lineup on Floor 12 of the Spiral Abyss.

Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 3.8, the three Lunar Phases will be as follows:

Phase I:

Fleeting Moon

Within 10s after the character enters the field, the character's Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks will deal 30% increased DMG. Their ATK SPD will also be increased by 10%. This effect will be canceled when the character leaves the field.

Phase II:

Shifting Moon

When a character loses or restores HP, all party members will gain 7.5% increased ATK for 10s. This effect can be triggered once every 0.1s. Max 4 stacks. Each stack will be counted independently.

Phase III:

Ingressing Moon

When the active character deals consecutive instances of Elemental DMG of the same Elemental Type or Physical DMG using Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attacks to an opponent, they will gain 1 count stack. 1 stack can be gained every 0.3s. The stacks for every Elemental and Physical DMG will be counted independently. After 6 stacks have been gained, a shockwave will be unleashed at the opponent's position, dealing True DMG and clearing all previously accumulated stacks for this DMG type. Should the active character leave the field, these stacks will be cleared.
