Complete daily training goals 5 times in a week to complete the weekly training goal for that week. You will accumulate progress for completing weekly training goals, which can be exchanged for the corresponding stage rewards.

● When you complete 8 weekly training goals, you can claim the Stella Fortuna reward. Travelers can select a desired character's Stella Fortuna from the characters on the event page's roster.

※ Stella Fortuna cannot be obtained for characters you have not obtained, or for characters who have already obtained a Stella Fortuna from past "To Temper Thyself and Journey Far" events.

※ During each season of the "To Temper Thyself and Journey Far" event, unclaimed Stella Fortuna rewards (earned by completing objectives) can only be exchanged for characters available in the current season. The selection opportunity does not carry over to the next season, so please select your character for exchange promptly.
