**〓Event Details〓**

● During the first 6 days of the event, one new challenge will be unlocked each day. During this challenge, you can use characters provided by the event or your own to form into two groups and complete the first and second halves of each combat trial.

● Each group in each stage can configure their own Vibro-Crystal setup to obtain different combat buffs. The Vibro-Crystals are divided into two types: Transmitter Crystals and Receiver Crystals. Transmitter Crystals govern the triggers for the buff effects, while Receiver Crystals will trigger the buffs once the conditions are met. After connecting Transmitter and Receiver Crystals, when the trigger conditions of the corresponding Transmitter Crystal is reached in the challenge, the buff effect of the corresponding Receiver Crystal can be obtained. Only the character that triggered the "Transmitter Crystal" will receive the buff effects.

● When multiple "Transmitter Crystals" are connected to the same "Receiver Crystal," the same effect triggered by using different conditions in the challenge will be stacked, and the effect will be slightly enhanced after stacking. Only the character that triggered the "Transmitter Crystal" will receive the stacked buff effects.

● The goal of the challenge is to defeat as many opponents as possible within the time limit to score points. When the challenge ends, you will receive medals based on this score and you will also obtain Primogems, Hero's Wit, Weapon Ascension Materials, Mystic Enhancement Ore, and Mora.

● Cannot start the challenge while in Co-Op Mode.

※ Elemental Resonances will not take effect in the "Vibro-Crystal Research" challenges, nor will you be able to use food or other items.
