Dear Travelers,

Our developers are expected to begin performing update maintenance at 2024/07/17 06:00:00 (global). Please stay tuned to related game update information.

Feature Preview:

Pre-installation function testing is estimated to start during Version 5.0 on Asia, Europe, and America servers on PS5™ and PS4™. During this time, when Travelers start playing on PS5™ or PS4™ and sufficient storage space is available, the device will automatically initiate pre-download of "Genshin Impact."
