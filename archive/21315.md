Dear Travelers,

Our developers are expected to begin performing update maintenance at <t class="t_gl" contenteditable="false">2025/09/10 06:00</t>. While the update maintenance is in progress, Travelers will be unable to log in to the game. Please stay tuned to related game update information.

After this is complete, the game will update to a new version. We recommend that Travelers install this update over a Wi-Fi connection.

Pre-installation is now available on mobile, PC, PlayStation®, and Xbox Series X|S.

After the version update, the PS4® version of Genshin Impact will be delisted from the PlayStation® Store and will no longer be available for download. However, Travelers who have already obtained the PS4® version of Genshin Impact will still be able to update and play the game on PS4® after the version update.

Update maintenance begins at <t class="t_gl" contenteditable="false">2025/09/10 06:00</t> and is estimated to take 5 hours.
