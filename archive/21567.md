◇ Weapon: Catalyst

◇ The Moon Maiden born in Nod-Krai, and also the welkin moon returning home.

◆ Columbina is a Hydro character who enables the team to simultaneously trigger Lunar-Charged, Lunar-Bloom, and Lunar-Crystallize reactions, while providing sustained off-field damage and support.

When Columbina casts her Elemental Skill, she summons a Gravity Ripple that follows the active character and continuously deals Hydro AoE DMG. While the Gravity Ripple is active, Gravity is accumulated whenever nearby characters trigger or deal Lunar Reaction DMG. When Gravity reaches its maximum, damage is dealt based on the Lunar reaction type that contributed the most Gravity.

Her Elemental Burst creates a Lunar Domain that enhances Lunar reactions triggered within it to varying degrees, and increases Lunar Reaction DMG dealt by all characters inside.

◇ Moonsign: Ascendant Gleam:
