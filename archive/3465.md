Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

There is an issue whereby the voice line for Alhaitham's Profile > Voice-Over "Opening Treasure Chest: III" cannot be displayed normally. This issue will be fixed in a future version.

There's an issue whereby when Yaoyao sprints after landing a Plunging Attack, the transition timing for her sprinting would be abnormal. This issue will be fixed in a future version. Please stay tuned for future notices.

There is an issue whereby some of Kamisato Ayaka's voicelines would fail to trigger properly after changing into the outfit "Springbloom Missive." This will be fixed in a future update. Please stay tuned for an announcement.
