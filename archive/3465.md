Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

There is an issue whereby there is a localization error in Japanese for the Combat Status "Sparks 'n' Splash" created by the "Klee" Character Card. This issue will be fixed in a future version. Please stay tuned for future notices.

There is an issue whereby there is a chance that the camera distance would become abnormal after some characters move swiftly or cast their Elemental Burst. This issue will be fixed in a future update. Please stay tuned for future notices. After the fix, the camera performance will be consistent with previous versions.

There is an issue whereby the voice line for Alhaitham's Profile > Voice-Over "Opening Treasure Chest: III" cannot be displayed normally. This issue will be fixed in a future version.

There's an issue whereby when Yaoyao sprints after landing a Plunging Attack, the transition timing for her sprinting would be abnormal. This issue will be fixed in a future version. Please stay tuned for future notices.

We have compensated Travelers who have unlocked Gnostic Chorus during Version 3.3's Battle Pass with a new exclusive Furnishing Blueprint "Port Ormos GP Crane III" via in-game mail. The mail will expire after 30 days, so don't forget to log into the game and claim the attached compensation in time.
