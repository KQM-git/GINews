〓Event Details〓

● During the event, you must use action points to throw fishing nets in order to catch various types of invasive fish.

● During the first 5 days of the event, the limit on the max amount of Wrangler Points you can earn will increase by 1,000 every 2 days. You can earn Wrangler Points or complete special actions to claim the corresponding rewards.

● The event features two modes: Co-Op Mode and Fish-Off Mode. In both modes, you can obtain Wrangler Points.

● Co-Op Mode: A certain amount of action points are provided at the start of the challenge and players have to work together to catch fish.

● Fish-Off Mode: Based on their current accumulated action points, players will compete against evenly-matched anglers to decide who the better fish-wrangler is.
