● During this event wish, the event-exclusive 5-star character "Scarlet Leaves Pursue Wild Waves" Kaedehara Kazuha (Anemo) will receive a huge drop-rate boost!

● During this event wish, the 4-star characters "Mottled Gold Yet Unsmelted" Kachina (Geo), "Blazing Riff" Xinyan (Pyro), and "Trial by Fire" Bennett (Pyro) will receive a huge drop-rate boost!

● After this event wish ends, the 4-star character "Mottled Gold Yet Unsmelted" Kachina (Geo) will be available in the standard wish "Wanderlust Invocation" in the next Version.

※ Of the above characters, the event-exclusive character will not be available in the standard wish "Wanderlust Invocation."

● The new "Capturing Radiance" mechanic has been added since this phase of "Character Event Wish" and "Character Event Wish-2." If it is not guaranteed to win the promotional 5-star character during this event wish, when winning a 5-star character, there is a chance of triggering the "Capturing Radiance" mechanic. If "Capturing Radiance" is triggered, the 5-star character you win in this event wish will be the promotional 5-star character.

※ This is for "Character Event Wish-2." The wish guarantee count for "Character Event Wish" and "Character Event Wish-2" is shared, and is accumulated between both "Character Event Wish" and "Character Event Wish-2." This wish guarantee count is independent of the guarantee counts of other types of wishes.

※ The "Test Run" trial event will be open during this event wish. Travelers may use fixed lineups containing the selected trial characters to enter specific stages and test them out. Travelers that complete the challenges will receive the corresponding rewards!

※ For more information, go to the Wish screen and select Details in the bottom-left corner.
