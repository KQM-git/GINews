Dear Travelers,

Our developers are expected to begin performing update maintenance at <t class="t_gl" contenteditable="false">2025/03/26 06:00</t>. While the update maintenance is in progress, Travelers will be unable to log in to the game. Please stay tuned to related game update information.

After this is complete, the game will update to a new version. We recommend that Travelers install this update over a Wi-Fi connection.

Pre-installation is now available on mobile, PC, and PlayStation®.

Additionally, this update introduces support for the pre-download function on Xbox, which has been enabled simultaneously. To access this feature, open the system main menu, select "My games & apps," select the "Manage" tab, and finally select the "Updates" page. If the page shows that the Genshin Impact pre-download is available, it means your device has received the pre-download notification. Travelers can then select the Genshin Impact game on this page to complete the pre-download.

If the pre-download prompt does not appear on the page, Travelers can wait for a while and then return to the page to check; or try restarting their device to receive the pre-download update notification.

Update maintenance begins at <t class="t_gl" contenteditable="false">2025/03/26 06:00</t> and is estimated to take 5 hours.
