〓Event Details〓

● At the start of the event, all five challenge types will be unlocked on the first day. Each time you start a challenge, you will be matched with 3 other players and enter a random type of challenge.

● Each challenge is split into 3 rounds, and each round into 2 phases: Gold Rush and Saurian Assault. You must get as many Trial Coins as possible in the 2 phases, thus scoring the highest number of points.

● After completing a challenge, you will receive a score based on your performance. During the first 5 days of the event, a 2,000-point score limit is unlocked every 2 days, with a maximum cap of 6,000 points. Accumulate a certain total score to claim corresponding rewards.
