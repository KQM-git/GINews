〓Event Details〓

● Challenge gameplay: You must select a difficulty first. After you enter a challenge, you must complete 3 phases, for a total of 3 time-limited battles. The challenge is considered complete once all opponents in all 3 battles are beaten.

● Difficulty: difficulty levels in ascending order are "Normal," "Advancing," "Hard," "Menacing," "Fearless," and "Dire."

The higher the initial difficulty selected, the more restrictive the rules applied during the challenge, and the tougher enemies will be.

From the "Hard" difficulty onward, you can only unlock the next difficulty by clearing the current one.

● "Exalted Ones": There can be a maximum of 16 "Exalted Ones" at any one time during the challenge.

"Exalted Ones" will obtain buff effects; adding them to your party will help you complete the challenge.

There can be a maximum of 16 "Exalted Ones" at any one time during the challenge, and their number is subject to change.

Under the "Dire" difficulty, "Exalted Ones" no longer obtain buff effects.

● Disturbance Outbreak: In the first 10 days from when the challenge is available, the Ley Line disturbance will be in an "Outbreak" state.

During the Disturbance Outbreak, players with Adventure Rank 45 and above can challenge stages at "Hard" difficulty onwards, and upon completing them, can consume Resin to earn the rewards from their chosen Domains of Blessing, while also accumulating Dire Prestige.

Accumulate a certain amount of Dire Prestige to receive extra Artifact rewards and Dust of Enlightenment.

After the Disturbance Outbreak ends, players will not be able to consume Resins to claim rewards from their selected Domain of Blessing.

● Completing a more difficult challenge will also let you obtain the rewards from the difficulties below that one.

Rewards for "Fearless" and "Dire" difficulties can only be claimed upon completing the single-player challenge.

● Co-Op Mode: All difficulty levels support Co-Op Mode of up to 4 players.

"Normal," "Advancing," and "Hard" difficulties support matchmaking or Co-Op Mode within the same world.

"Menacing," "Fearless," and "Dire" difficulties only support Co-Op challenges within the same world.
