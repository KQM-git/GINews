Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

Currently, when some characters challenge the boss "All-Devouring Narwhal," there is a chance of an issue where DMG numbers won't display when inflicting DMG (but the actual DMG inflicted is correct). This issue will be fixed in a later version update. Please stay tuned for future notices.
