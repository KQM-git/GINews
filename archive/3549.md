**〓Event Details〓**

● During the first 8 days of the "Brewing Developments" event, one new challenge will be unlocked every 2 days.

● During each challenge, you can use the trial characters provided by the event or your own to complete 3 consecutive combat rounds.

● The Shock-Boiled Brew allocated for each round has 4 potential effects. The Shock-Boiling Device will automatically use the Shock-Boiled Brew and can randomly activate one or more effects for a certain period of time, providing tremendous support during combat.

● The goal of the challenge is to defeat as many opponents as possible within the time limit to score points. When the challenge ends, you will receive Primogems, Talent Level-Up Materials, Hero's Wit, Mystic Enhancement Ore, and Mora based on this score.

※ Food and other items will not be available during these challenges.
