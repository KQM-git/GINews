It is said that these ruins are all that is left of what was once a ring-shaped ceremonial site. Here, these sages attempted to perfect the rituals required to transform phlogiston.

Later, even before they were used to resist common enemies, these powers were employed as weapons in conflicts between the tribes. Disheartened by this state of affairs, the Sage of the Stolen Flame withdrew from the world, vanishing from the pages of many tales. Devoid of their original purpose, these empty trial grounds were left behind, along with all those stories that came to be forgotten...

## Update Summary
![Banner](https://sdk.hoyoverse.com/upload/announcement/2020/11/11/0c4d0c742dde8334be30352fa3f5fb5b_4067277611421326976.jpg)

Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

- There is an issue whereby Kinich may be able to perform an abnormal vertical jump when using his Elemental Skill to swing in mid-air under certain specific circumstances.

In Version 5.1, the developers will fix the following issue:

When Kinich uses his Elemental Skill to swing in mid-air and simultaneously executes a Normal Attack, it can result in an abnormal vertical jump.

The developers will continue to monitor other actions that may cause this character to perform abnormal vertical jumps. If there are any subsequent plans for adjustments and corrections, we will notify Travelers via announcements.

- There is an issue under specific circumstances whereby the duration of Mualani and Kachina's special movement mode under the Nightsoul's Blessing state would be abnormal. This issue will be fixed in a subsequent update.

Updates resources related to subsequent events.

〓<t class="t_gl" contenteditable="false">2024/09/10 11:10:00</t> Update Details〓

〓<t class="t_gl" contenteditable="false">2024/09/05 16:15:00</t> Update Details〓

- Fixes a text error in Traditional Chinese in the "Hmm? Natlan?" Commission Quest description.

- Fixes an issue whereby some scene objects would abnormally disappear on some Android devices with Mali G57 GPUs.

- Improves an issue whereby the achievement "Polychrome Tri-Stars" could not be completed. Travelers who encountered this issue can achieve the accomplishment by re-completing the relevant challenges after the fix. If the issue persists, Travelers can report the issue through the Feedback tab in the Paimon Menu.

Currently, there is still a small chance that the achievement "Polychrome Tri-Stars" may not be completed in Co-Op Mode under certain circumstances. This issue will be fully resolved in a future update.

Travelers affected by the above issues can log out via the Paimon Menu and close the game, then log in again to resolve the issues.

〓<t class="t_gl" contenteditable="false">2024/08/30 18:15:00</t> Update Details〓

〓<t class="t_gl" contenteditable="false">2024/08/30 12:30:00</t> Update Details〓

Fixes an issue whereby there was a chance that the achievement "Only the Night Breeze Can Be Heard" could not be completed. Travelers who encountered this issue can try again to complete the achievement normally once the issue has been fixed.

〓<t class="t_gl" contenteditable="false">2024/08/30 11:10:00</t> Update Details〓

- Fixes an issue whereby on certain devices with "Lowest" Graphic Quality settings, Kachina's expression would appear to be abnormal in the Archon Quest "Natlan! A New Adventure."

We will send the corresponding chest rewards to Travelers who completed the domain but were unable to open the chest, via in-game mail within 72 hours after the issue is fixed.

To ensure a fair and healthy Genshin Impact gaming environment and offer Travelers a great gaming experience, we would like to remind everyone that the following rules apply to all Travelers at all times:

1) The use of plug-ins, accelerators, and any other third-party tools that affect the fairness of the game is strictly forbidden.

COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. (herein referred to as "we") will respond to any such activity by taking measures including but not limited to removal of inappropriately obtained rewards, suspension of accounts, and permanent banning of accounts, with the precise measures to be decided based on the seriousness and number of violations.

2) The sale, purchase, or transfer of accounts by any means is strictly forbidden.

We urge Travelers to protect their personal property and information, ignore any requests for account sharing or trading, and refrain from purchasing accounts on other platforms. Likewise, Travelers are forbidden from sharing or selling their own account.

In accordance with Genshin Impact's Terms of Service, we will not be responsible for any personal information leaks or damages resulting from a Traveler's own actions.

We will respond to any such activity by taking measures including but not limited to removal of inappropriately obtained rewards, suspension of accounts, and permanent banning of accounts, with the precise measures to be decided based on the seriousness and number of violations.
