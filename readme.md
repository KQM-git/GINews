◇ The Moon Maiden born in Nod-Krai, and also the welkin moon returning home.

◆ Columbina is a Hydro character who enables the team to simultaneously trigger Lunar-Charged, Lunar-Bloom, and Lunar-Crystallize reactions, while providing sustained off-field damage and support.

When Columbina casts her Elemental Skill, she summons a Gravity Ripple that follows the active character and continuously deals Hydro AoE DMG. While the Gravity Ripple is active, Gravity is accumulated whenever nearby characters trigger or deal Lunar Reaction DMG. When Gravity reaches its maximum, damage is dealt based on the Lunar reaction type that contributed the most Gravity.

Her Elemental Burst creates a Lunar Domain that enhances Lunar reactions triggered within it to varying degrees, and increases Lunar Reaction DMG dealt by all characters inside.

◇ Moonsign: Ascendant Gleam:

Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

- There is an issue whereby under certain circumstances, after achieving victory in the Trounce Domain "False Moon Institute," Travelers may still find the "The Doctor" entry locked in the "Living Beings" section of the Archive.

Travelers affected by the above issue can defeat The Doctor outside the rift from beyond this world to unlock the entry as intended. This issue will be fixed in a future update.

- The devs will optimize the background music for a cutscene animation in the Archon Quest "True Moon" after the "Luna V" update. This optimized version of the background music will also be used in the upcoming official cutscene animation video.

- Currently, when Neuvillette performed certain actions (such as moving, Normal Attacks, etc.) after using his Elemental Burst while wearing to the outfit "Melusent Gift," the back of the outfit lacks the fluttering effect. This issue will be fixed in the Version "Luna V" update.

〓<t class="t_gl" contenteditable="false">2026/01/16 12:10</t> Update Details〓

Fixes an issue whereby after the "Traveler" resonated with multiple elements and unlocked additional Talents, in certain scenarios, the additional Talents would only provide attribute boosts based on the current resonating element.

〓<t class="t_gl" contenteditable="false">2026/01/16 11:10</t> Update Details〓

Fixes an issue whereby the game scene might become abnormal when carrying out the quest objective "Enter the world in the mirror" in the Archon Quest "A Traveler on a Winter's Night" on certain devices, resulting in the quest not being able to proceed.

〓<t class="t_gl" contenteditable="false">2026/01/14 20:45</t> Update Details〓

- Fixes an issue after the Version "Luna IV" update whereby some characters' Passive Talent effects such as "some creatures will not be startled when approached" and other similar effects could fail to take effect abnormally.

- Fixes an issue that caused the number of "Arcane Keystones" and "Geodes of Replication" to be displayed incorrectly on the "Ode" button after changing pages in the “Ode” screen in “Miliastra Wonderland” when using a controller.
