<details open="true">
<summary><span>New Areas in Liyue Now Available</span></summary>

◇ New Areas: In Version 4.4, the following areas in Liyue will become available: Chenyu Vale: Upper Vale, Chenyu Vale: Southern Mountain, and Mt. Laixin.

※ As long as you have completed Archon Quest Prologue: Act III "Song of the Dragon and Freedom," a Teleport Waypoint will be automatically unlocked near Liyue's Chenyu Vale: Upper Vale (If you have already completed this Archon Quest, the Teleport Waypoint will be unlocked after the update). You'll also receive the Primogem reward for this Teleport Waypoint when it unlocks automatically.

▌New System in Liyue

Rainjade Oblation

Fujin's adeptal energy has transformed into many Spirit Carp that are scattered all over Chenyu Vale. Collect the energy within Spirit Carp and transfer it into the Votive Rainjade within Carp's Rest to increase its level and obtain the blessings of Chenyu Vale.

Rainjade Oblation System Unlock Criteria:

• Complete the World Quest "The Cloud-Padded Path to the Chiwang Repose"

In addition, there will be new Fishing Points and "Radiant Spincrystals" in Liyue.

</details>
II. New Characters

<details open="true">
<summary><span style="color:rgba(53,150,151,1)"><span>5-Star Character "Passerine Herald" Xianyun (Anemo)</span></span></summary>

◇ Vision: Anemo

◇ Weapon: Catalyst

◇ One of the Mighty and Illuminated Adepti of Jueyun, known as "Cloud Retainer." Expert in all kinds of mechanical contraptions, her heart now turns towards the affairs of the mortal world, through which she walks under the name "Xianyun."

◆ Elemental Skill "White Clouds at Dawn"

◆ Xianyun enters the Cloud Transmogrification state, in which she will not take Fall DMG, and uses Skyladder once. In this state, Xianyun can cast Skyladder continuously to leap, where her Plunging Attack will be converted into an even stronger Driftcloud Wave instead, which deals AoE Anemo DMG. The more times Skyladder is used, the more DMG the resulting Driftcloud Wave will deal and the larger its AoE.

◆ Elemental Burst "Stars Gather at Dusk"

◆ Brings forth a sacred breeze that deals AoE Anemo DMG and heals all nearby characters. It will also summon the "Starwicker" mechanism that follows the active character and periodically heals all nearby party members. When the Starwicker has Adeptal Assistance stacks, characters will have their jump height increased. When they complete a Plunging Attack, Adeptal Assistance stacks will be consumed and deal AoE Anemo DMG.

</details>

<details open="true">
<summary><span style="color:rgba(236,73,35,1)"><span>4-Star Character "Leonine Vanguard" Gaming (Pyro)</span></span></summary>

◇ Vision: Pyro

◇ Weapon: Claymore

◇ Guard of the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency, and the head of the "Mighty Mythical Beasts" Wushou troupe.

◆ Elemental Skill "Bestial Ascent"

◆ Gaming pounces forward using the Wushou arts, leaping high into the air after coming into contact with a target or surface. If he immediately uses a Plunging Attack, he will use Plunging Attack: Charmed Cloudstrider instead, dealing AoE Pyro DMG to opponents hit.

◆ Elemental Burst "Suanni's Gilded Dance"

◆ Gaming enters Wushou Stance, briefly applying Pyro to him, recovering a fixed amount of HP, and summons his companion, the Suanni Man Chai, to smash into his target, dealing AoE Pyro DMG. After doing so, Man Chai will then attempt to roll towards Gaming. When it links up with Gaming, Man Chai will leave the field and reset the CD for Gaming's Elemental Skill, Bestial Ascent. While Wushou Stance is active, his resistance to interruption is increased, and when Gaming lands with Charmed Cloudstrider attack or completes the forward pounce attack from Bestial Ascent with over 50% HP, he will summon Man Chai again.

</details>
III. New Equipment

New Weapon (Examples based on Refinement Rank 1)

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Crane's Echoing Call (5-Star Catalyst)</span></summary>

After the equipping character hits an opponent with a Plunging Attack, all nearby party members' Plunging Attacks will deal 28% increased DMG for 20s. When nearby party members hit opponents with Plunging Attacks, they will restore 2.5 Energy to the equipping character. Energy can be restored this way every 0.7s. This energy regain effect can be triggered even if the equipping character is not on the field.

◆ During the event wish "Epitome Invocation," the event-exclusive 5-star weapon Crane's Echoing Call (Catalyst) will receive a huge drop-rate boost!

</details>
IV. New Outfits

<details open="true">

</details>

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Shenhe: Frostflower Dew</span></summary>

◇ This Lantern Rite gift that Shenhe received is a set of elegant formal attire that her master, Cloud Retainer had commissioned for her. Red ropes still adorn her arms, but the bitter cold in Shenhe's heart has faded.

◆ Between the start of the Version 4.4 update and 2024/03/11 03:59:59 (server), Shenhe's outfit "Frostflower Dew" will be available for purchase in the Character Outfit Shop at a limited-time discount! During the discount period, the price of the outfit is 1,350 Genesis Crystals. The price will revert to 1,680 Genesis Crystals after the limited-time discount ends. The outfit can only be purchased once.

</details>

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Xingqiu: Bamboo Rain</span></summary>

◇ Formal wear prepared by the Feiyun Commerce Guild for Xingqiu. The bamboo prints are refined and the cut is most flattering, but Xingqiu's favorite aspect of the outfit is its inner pockets, into which a thinner novel might be stuffed.

◆ During Version 4.4, Travelers can obtain Xingqiu's outfit "Bamboo Rain" for free by participating in the limited-time "Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze" event.

◆ After Version 4.4 is over, Travelers can buy the outfit in the Character Outfit Shop.

〓Eligibility〓

Travelers who have reached Adventure Rank 10 or above can participate in this event.

〓Event Description〓

During the event, you can log in to Genshin Impact daily, claim Commission Rewards, consume Original Resin, and complete other missions to obtain the event item: Pale Yellow Silk Paper.

Pale Yellow Silk Paper can be used to unlock the various sections of the event and to search for the correct options. Once you choose the correct option, you'll be able to obtain Primogems and other in-game rewards.

〓Event Details〓

- You can obtain the event item: Pale Yellow Silk Paper through the following methods: Complete missions such as logging into Genshin Impact every day, claiming Commission Rewards 2 times daily, and using a total of 40 Original Resin daily to obtain the corresponding amount of Pale Yellow Silk Paper.

- Daily missions refresh at 04:00 (Server Time) each day. Unclaimed Pale Yellow Silk Paper will also be cleared by then. Please claim and use it in time. Claimed Pale Yellow Silk Paper will not be cleared.

- A certain amount of Pale Yellow Silk Paper can be used to unlock different sections. There are a total of 5 sections in the event, each of which is on a different stage. You can click the Suanni and Crane buttons on the home page to switch between different stages and enter the corresponding sections.

- After unlocking a section, you can play it multiple times until you've selected the correct option to obtain in-game rewards.

- In each section, there are a total of three options to choose from. After you've chosen an option, you can flip it over to see the companion or item hidden behind.

- Once you've flipped over the correct option, you'll have completed the challenge and will be able to obtain in-game rewards. If you flip over the wrong one, the companion or item behind will stay on the stage. You can continue flipping over the remaining options until you've selected the correct one in order to obtain in-game rewards.

- If you leave halfway through, your progress will not be saved but your Pale Yellow Silk Paper will not be consumed either. You can try again multiple times.

*If Travelers try to visit the event at around 04:00 (Server Time), which is when the daily missions refresh, they may encounter a brief network error. Please refresh the page if you encounter this error.

〓Event Rewards〓

After you've unlocked all of the sections and completed the challenges, you'll be able to obtain Primogems ×120, Mystic Enhancement Ore ×10, Hero's Wit ×10, and Mora ×70,000. Also, after completing three sections and their challenges, you'll obtain a special reward: the blueprint for the Serenitea Pot Furnishing "Valley Store: The Leisure of Tea."

*The in-game rewards will be distributed via in-game mail. The mail will expire after 30 days, so don't forget to claim the rewards in time.

*This web event is provided purely for entertainment. It is not indicative of any related gameplay features in Genshin Impact.
