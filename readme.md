Updated the monster lineup on Floors 11 – 12 of the Spiral Abyss.

After the Version 4.7 update, the Abyssal Moon Spire will reset itself every month, with a new Lunar Phase occurring on the sixteenth day. The "Star's Bounty" rewards for earning 9 Abyssal Stars from the Abyssal Moon Spire, that is Floors 9 – 12 of the Spiral Abyss, are increased.

Previously, after earning 9 Abyssal Stars, you could obtain the "Star's Bounty" rewards of a total of Primogems ×150.

The tally can increase by 1 up to once every 0.1s, and once it reaches 3, a shockwave is unleashed at the opponent's location that deals True DMG to nearby opponents, and the tally will be reset. Up to 1 shockwave can be unleashed this way every 1.5s, and the effect and tally are cleared when the character leaves the field.

Phase II:

Transfusing Moon

After this character receives healing, their Elemental Skill DMG is increased by 20%. Lasts for 8s, up to 3 stacks. Each stack duration is calculated independently.

〓Bug Fixes〓

● Characters

- Fixes an issue whereby, after triggering the "Tapestry" effect of the Passive Talent "Tailor-Made" and then switching to another character, the effect of the weapon "Haran Geppaku Futsu" could not be triggered.

- Fixes an issue whereby, when Arlecchino entered her Masque of the Red Death State, there was a small chance that the Normal Attack DMG increase would be abnormal in certain situations.

- Fixes an issue whereby there is still a small probability that C1 Arlecchino's interruption resistance increase would be abnormal when she performs Normal or Charged Attacks while affected by the Masque of the Red Death under specific circumstances.

![Banner](https://sdk.hoyoverse.com/upload/announcement/2020/11/11/0c4d0c742dde8334be30352fa3f5fb5b_4067277611421326976.jpg)

Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

- There is an issue whereby testing voice-over resources were incorrectly used for some of Sethos's Chinese voice-overs in the cutscene animation of Cyno's Story Quest Lupus Aureus Chapter: Act II "Oathkeeper." This resource was not recorded by Chinese voice actor 李兰陵 Lanling Li.

This issue will be fixed in Version 4.8.

〓2024/06/27 16:10:00 (global) Update Details〓

Fixes an issue under certain circumstances whereby a Common Chest in Sigewinne's Story Quest Domain could not be opened normally.

〓2024/06/20 16:15:00 (global) Update Details〓

Updates resources related to subsequent events.

〓2024/06/14 11:10:00 (global) Update Details〓

- Fixes an issue whereby enemies in some areas or quests (e.g. in the Tunigi Hollow, or the enemy "Arakawa Kouji" in Yae Miko's Story Quest) have a probability of abnormally leaving combat and recovering HP, and are unable to be defeated after the Version 4.7 update.

Travelers affected by the above issue can log out via the Paimon Menu and close the game, then log in again to continue the game as normal.

- The fix for "the issue whereby the sorting of Artifacts in the 'Inventory > Artifacts' interface would appear incorrectly under certain circumstances after the Version 4.7 update" carried out on June 13 has resulted in abnormal lags for the Artifacts Batch Destroy function, and has thus been rolled back. This issue will be fixed in Version 4.8.

〓2024/06/13 16:10:00 (global) Update Details〓

- Fixes an issue whereby there was missing text in the quest item "Invitation From the Arataki Gang" after the Version 4.7 update.

- Fixes an issue whereby the red dots in the Adventurer Handbook could not be removed under certain circumstances after the Version 4.7 update.

- Fixes an issue whereby the sorting of Artifacts in the "Inventory > Artifacts" interface would appear incorrectly under certain circumstances after the Version 4.7 update.

- Fixes an issue in "Genius Invokation TCG" whereby after the summon "Singer of Many Waters" of the character card "Furina" switches state to "Salon Members," the effects of other summons would be incorrectly evaluated during the end of turn under certain circumstances.

- Fixes an issue whereby the actual Render Resolution of some Android devices with low memory was lower than expected, resulting in blurry graphics after the Version 4.7 update.

- Fixes an issue whereby the number of "resonances" triggered was abnormal when using Geo constructs to resonate with the "Unique Rock Pillars" after the Version 4.7 update.

Travelers affected by the above issues can log out via the Paimon Menu and close the game client, then log in again to continue the game as normal.

〓2024/06/06 18:40:00 (global) Update Details〓

- Fixes an issue whereby after the Version 4.7 update, Neuvillette's Charged Attack "Equitable Judgment" is more likely to be obstructed by certain terrain or Stone Steles under specific circumstances in comparison to previous versions.

- Fixes an issue under certain circumstances whereby Travelers using controllers with iOS devices will encounter issues of corresponding skill icons not displaying for the trigger buttons and the buttons not working when pressed (taking the XBOX wireless controller as an example, corresponding to the LT and RT buttons).

Travelers who encountered this issue may exit the game via the Paimon Menu, close the game client, and log into the game again to proceed as normal.

To ensure a fair and healthy Genshin Impact gaming environment and offer Travelers a great gaming experience, we would like to remind everyone that the following rules apply to all Travelers at all times:

1) The use of plug-ins, accelerators, and any other third-party tools that affect the fairness of the game is strictly forbidden.

COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. (herein referred to as "we") will respond to any such activity by taking measures including but not limited to removal of inappropriately obtained rewards, suspension of accounts, and permanent banning of accounts, with the precise measures to be decided based on the seriousness and number of violations.

2) The sale, purchase, or transfer of accounts by any means is strictly forbidden.

We urge Travelers to protect their personal property and information, ignore any requests for account sharing or trading, and refrain from purchasing accounts on other platforms. Likewise, Travelers are forbidden from sharing or selling their own account.

In accordance with Genshin Impact's Terms of Service, we will not be responsible for any personal information leaks or damages resulting from a Traveler's own actions.

We will respond to any such activity by taking measures including but not limited to removal of inappropriately obtained rewards, suspension of accounts, and permanent banning of accounts, with the precise measures to be decided based on the seriousness and number of violations.

We are committed to guaranteeing the fair gameplay of Genshin Impact and to safeguarding Travelers' in-game assets. As we endeavor to constantly improve Genshin Impact, we wholeheartedly hope that Travelers join us in creating and maintaining a fair and harmonious gaming environment.
