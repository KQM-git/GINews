Under the Ousia alignment, she will deal AoE Hydro DMG and summon 3 Salon Members: the Ball Octopus-shaped Gentilhomme Usher, the Bubbly Seahorse-shaped Surintendante Chevalmarin, and the Armored Crab-shaped Mademoiselle Crabaletta. Salon Members will attack nearby opponents at intervals and consume the HP of nearby party members, which can increase the power of their current attacks. Under the Pneuma alignment, she summons the Singer of Many Waters, which periodically heals nearby active characters. The Salon Members and Singer of Many Waters share a duration, and when Furina uses her Charged Attack to change the guest type, the new guests will inherit the remaining duration.

During this time, when nearby party members' HP increases or decreases, Fanfare points will be granted to Furina based on the amount by which their HP changes.

When held, Charlotte enters Composition Mode, and during this time, the viewfinder will expand as you hold until you reach a Finisher Frame state. When the hold state ends, Cryo DMG will be dealt to all opponents locked on within the viewfinder, and Snappy Silhouette is applied. If you unleash this ability only after reaching Finisher Frame, you will instead apply Focused Impression, which lasts longer and deals more DMG.

◆ Elemental Burst "Still Photo: Comprehensive Confirmation"

## Update Summary
![Banner](https://sdk.hoyoverse.com/upload/announcement/2020/11/11/0c4d0c742dde8334be30352fa3f5fb5b_4067277611421326976.jpg)

Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

Currently, when some characters challenge the boss "All-Devouring Narwhal," there is a chance of an issue where DMG numbers won't display when inflicting DMG (but the actual DMG inflicted is correct). This issue will be fixed in a later version update. Please stay tuned for future notices.

What original sin does the God of Justice, who claims to judge the gods, herself bear... One cannot make an enemy of the divine. If the Heavenly Principles are not to be defied, the answer shouldn't be to bow one's head and wait for death. Instead, let there be a spin, a hop, and a skip. Then, let the "sinner" take a final bow.

After reaching the corresponding Adventure Rank and completing the prerequisite quests, Archon Quest Chapter IV: Act V "Masquerade of the Guilty" will appear in the Quest Menu.

(After these quests are unlocked, access the Quest Menu by: pressing "J" on PC (default settings); tapping the Quest Menu icon in the top-left corner on mobile; or pressing and holding L1 on PS5™ or PS4™ to open the shortcut wheel and select the Quest Menu icon.)

To ensure a fair and healthy Genshin Impact gaming environment and offer Travelers a great gaming experience, we would like to remind everyone that the following rules apply to all Travelers at all times:

1) The use of plug-ins, accelerators, and any other third-party tools that affect the fairness of the game is strictly forbidden.

COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. (herein referred to as "we") will respond to any such activity by taking measures including but not limited to removal of inappropriately obtained rewards, suspension of accounts, and permanent banning of accounts, with the precise measures to be decided based on the seriousness and number of violations.

2) The sale, purchase, or transfer of accounts by any means is strictly forbidden.

We urge Travelers to protect their personal property and information, ignore any requests for account sharing or trading, and refrain from purchasing accounts on other platforms. Likewise, Travelers are forbidden from sharing or selling their own account.

In accordance with Genshin Impact's Terms of Service, we will not be responsible for any personal information leaks or damages resulting from a Traveler's own actions.

3) Top-up via non-official channels and third parties is strictly forbidden.

We will respond to any such activity by taking measures including but not limited to removal of inappropriately obtained rewards, suspension of accounts, and permanent banning of accounts, with the precise measures to be decided based on the seriousness and number of violations.

We are committed to guaranteeing the fair gameplay of Genshin Impact and to safeguarding Travelers' in-game assets. As we endeavor to constantly improve Genshin Impact, we wholeheartedly hope that Travelers join us in creating and maintaining a fair and harmonious gaming environment.
