◆ Elemental Skill: Hunter's Vigil

◆ Preparing her pistolet, she enters the "Night Vigil" state. In this state, Clorinde's Normal Attacks will be transformed into "Swift Hunt" pistolet attacks that help accumulate her Bond of Life, and her Elemental Skill will be transformed into "Impale the Night" that clears her Bond of Life and heals her while performing a lunging attack. When her Bond of Life is relatively low, "Swift Hunt" pistolet attacks will be able to pierce opponents. When her Bond of Life is relatively high, the AoE and the DMG dealt by "Impale the Night" will be increased.

◆ Hold to blow a Bolstering Bubblebalm that bounces between nearby opponents and imprisons weaker opponents, dealing Hydro DMG. When it bounces, it will restore HP to all nearby party members except Sigewinne herself. When the Bolstering Bubblebalm disappears, it will restore HP to Sigewinne. In addition, Sourcewater Droplets will be created near Sigewinne when she uses this Skill. Each Sourcewater Droplet Sigewinne collects will grant her a Bond of Life. When Sigewinne's Bond of Life is cleared, she regains Elemental Energy based on the amount of Bond of Life that was cleared.

◆ Elemental Burst: Super Saturated Syringing

◆ Elemental Skill: Ancient Rite: The Thundering Sands

◆ Gathers the might of thunder, dealing AoE Electro DMG and quickly retreating. If this attack triggers an Electro-related reaction, Sethos recovers a certain amount of Elemental Energy.

◆ Elemental Burst: Secret Rite: Twilight Shadowpiercer

- Spiral Abyss

Floor 11 Ley Line Disorder changed to:

• All characters in the party gain a 60% Electro DMG Bonus.

• All party members receive a 60% Hydro DMG Bonus.

Updated the monster lineup on Floors 11 – 12 of the Spiral Abyss.

After the Version 4.7 update, the Abyssal Moon Spire will reset itself every month, with a new Lunar Phase occurring on the sixteenth day. The "Star's Bounty" rewards for earning 9 Abyssal Stars from the Abyssal Moon Spire, that is Floors 9 – 12 of the Spiral Abyss, are increased.

Previously, after earning 9 Abyssal Stars, you could obtain the "Star's Bounty" rewards of a total of Primogems ×150. Once the the Abyssal Moon Spire resets on the sixteenth day of every month, after earning 9 Abyssal Stars on any Floor of the Abyssal Moon Spire, you can obtain the "Star's Bounty" rewards of a total of Primogems ×200.

Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after the update, the two Lunar Phases will be as follows:

Phase I:

Thrusting Moon

For 10s after the active character uses their Elemental Skill, DMG dealt by their Normal Attacks is increased by 20%, and a tally will be kept when this character's Normal Attacks hit opponents. The tally can increase by 1 up to once every 0.1s, and once it reaches 3, a shockwave is unleashed at the opponent's location that deals True DMG to nearby opponents, and the tally will be reset. Up to 1 shockwave can be unleashed this way every 1.5s, and the effect and tally are cleared when the character leaves the field.

Phase II:

Transfusing Moon

After this character receives healing, their Elemental Skill DMG is increased by 20%. Lasts for 8s, up to 3 stacks. Each stack duration is calculated independently.

Fixes an issue whereby, when fighting the Experimental Field Generator, Automated Supercomputing Field Generator, and Veteran Arithmetic Enhancer Mek, there was a small chance that characters would not receive a boost to their jump height after the enemy had unleashed a Gravity Reduction Field in certain situations.

● Characters

- Fixes an issue whereby, after triggering the "Tapestry" effect of the Passive Talent "Tailor-Made" and then switching to another character, the effect of the weapon "Haran Geppaku Futsu" could not be triggered.

- Fixes an issue whereby, when Arlecchino entered her Masque of the Red Death State, there was a small chance that the Normal Attack DMG increase would be abnormal in certain situations.

- Fixes an issue whereby there is still a small probability that C1 Arlecchino's interruption resistance increase would be abnormal when she performs Normal or Charged Attacks while affected by the Masque of the Red Death under specific circumstances.

- Fixes an issue whereby Nilou's weapon model would display abnormally if she cast her Elemental Skill immediately after using her Elemental Burst.

- Fixes an issue whereby, after Lyney had stacked Prop Surplus, if the character was switched due to the Overloaded reaction being triggered, Prop Surplus stacks would not be consumed after the character that was switched to received a healing effect from the Prop Surplus.

- Fixes an issue whereby when Neuvillette was preparing the skill "Equitable Judgment," if he was switched to another character as a result of triggering an Elemental Reaction (such as Overloaded) or for any other reason, the skill that Neuvillette was preparing would not be canceled. Neuvillette's skill description has also been optimized.

● System

- Fixes an issue whereby, after completing the Spiral Abyss, the buttons on the finalization screen could be interacted with before they had even appeared.

- Fixes an issue whereby Furnishing Set Blueprints could not be found when using the Filter function on the Realm Depot > Furnishing Blueprints interface.

● Audio

- Fixes an issue whereby the sound effects for Prince of Dragonborn: Scylla, in the Sea of Bygone Eras would trigger abnormally when on land.

- Fixes an issue whereby when "Gliding Champion" Amber (Pyro) used the wind glider, her lines would have a certain chance of repeating twice.

- Fixes an issue whereby there was an error with the Chinese voice-over during a quest.

● Other

- Fixes some text errors in certain languages and optimizes text. (Note: Related in-game functions have not changed. Travelers can view the changes in different languages by going to the Paimon Menu > Settings > Language and changing the Game Language.)
