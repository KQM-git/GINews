What original sin does the God of Justice, who claims to judge the gods, herself bear... One cannot make an enemy of the divine. If the Heavenly Principles are not to be defied, the answer shouldn't be to bow one's head and wait for death. Instead, let there be a spin, a hop, and a skip. Then, let the "sinner" take a final bow.
