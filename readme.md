〓Update Details〓

I. New Character

<details open="true">
<summary><span style="color:rgba(204,144,70,1)"><span>5-Star Character "The Thundering Seamstress" Chiori (Geo)</span></span></summary>

◇ Vision: Geo

◇ Weapon: Sword

◇ The owner of Chioriya Boutique. A tailor renowned throughout Fontaine.

◆ Elemental Skill: Fluttering Hasode

◆ Chiori dashes nimbly forward with silken steps, dealing AoE Geo DMG to nearby opponents based on her ATK and DEF, and summons the automaton doll "Tamoto." Tamoto will also deal AoE Geo DMG to nearby opponents based on Chiori's ATK and DEF. While Tamoto is active, if there are nearby Geo Construct(s) or Geo Construct(s) are created, an additional Tamoto will be summoned next to your character on the field. Only 1 additional Tamoto can be summoned in this manner.

◆ Elemental Burst: Hiyoku: Twin Blades

◆ Twin blades leave their sheaths as Chiori slices with the clean cuts of a master tailor, dealing an instance of AoE Geo DMG based on her ATK and DEF.

◇ Chiori's Passive Talent "Tailor-Made" will cause you to gain different effects depending on the next action you take within a short duration after using her Elemental Skill "Fluttering Hasode"'s upward sweep: switches to the next character in your roster and enables "Tamoto" to execute coordinated attacks, or Chiori will remain on the field and gain a Geo infusion.

</details>
II. New Equipment

<details open="true">

◆ During the event wish "Epitome Invocation," the event-exclusive 5-star weapon Uraku Misugiri (Sword) will receive a huge drop-rate boost!

</details>

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Dialogues of the Desert Sages (4-Star Polearm)</span></summary>

When the wielder performs healing, restore 8 Energy. This effect can be triggered once every 10s and can occur even when the character is not on the field.

Updated the monster lineup on Floors 11 – 12 of the Spiral Abyss.

Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 4.5, the three Lunar Phases will be as follows:

Phase I:

Sundered Moon

When characters create Geo Constructs, unleash a shockwave at the character's location, dealing True DMG to nearby opponents. 1 such shockwave can be unleashed every 6s.

Phase II:

Gravel Moon

When a character deals Geo DMG to an opponent, this instance will be counted for the character. 1 count can be gained every 0.1s. When the count reaches 3, this character will receive a Gravel Mark, granting them 50% Geo DMG Bonus for 10s.

Phase III:

Arrowgale Moon

After a character triggers a Swirl reaction, all party members' Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attack DMG is increased by 20% for 10s. This effect can be triggered once every 0.1s. Max 3 stacks. Each stack's duration is counted independently.
