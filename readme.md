- Fixes an issue whereby there was a small chance that the HP of Character Cards would overlap abnormally when watching Genius Invokation TCG duels.

- Fixes an issue in Genius Invokation TCG whereby if you had 0 Elemental Dice before the Action Phase began, you would still be able to abnormally play the Event Card "Covenant of Rock" due to the Omni Element generated by the Equipment Card "Gambler's Earrings" after the Action Phase began. (Under normal conditions, "Covenant of Rock" should not have been playable as you had more than 0 Elemental Dice at this time.)

- Fixes an issue whereby there was a small chance that the Crystalfly Trap wouldn't appear after being used in certain situations.

- Fixes an issue whereby the Waverider's attacks would not automatically lock onto Explosive Barrels in certain situations.

- Fixes an issue whereby some enemies in the water and some characters in swimming mode were unable to take DMG from Electro-Charged Reactions in certain water bodies.

- Fixes an issue whereby some gadgets would still produce leftover special effects after the character had gone underwater.
