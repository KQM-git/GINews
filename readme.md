Dear Travelers,

Our developers are expected to begin performing update maintenance at 2023/08/16 06:00:00 (global). Please stay tuned to related game update information.

In Version 4.0, some game files have been adjusted to optimize the gaming experience, meaning that this update will require a large amount of space.

We recommend that you save sufficient space on your device and complete this pre-installation over a Wi-Fi connection.

The pre-installation resource package size for PCs will be between 32.0 – 34.2 GB, and the space required for unzipping will be 64.0 - 68.4 GB. The pre-installation resource package size for mobile devices will be between 8.1 – 10.8 GB (the voice-over files installed will affect the size of the space required for pre-installation).

Regardless of whether you complete pre-installation, any content you download in advance will increase the download speed during the version update.

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Veluriyam Mirage</span></summary>

This is a story that takes place within the confines of a little glass bottle. Rumor tells of a mysterious domain in the center of the desert, and it is said that those who enter shall be granted their heart's desire.

But who is to say whether there is any truth in this? Who knows if the fervor of countless travelers, filling this world inside a bottle to the very brim, is nothing but a mirage?

◇ Area Unlock Criteria:

• Adventure Rank 18 or above

• Complete the Archon Quest "Song of the Dragon and Freedom"

(Complete Archon Quest Chapter III: Act V "Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises," Eula's Story Quest "Aphros Delos Chapter: Act I," and Sangonomiya Kokomi's Story Quest "Dracaena Somnolenta Chapter: Act I" first to get the best experience from this event.)

◆ The Veluriyam Mirage will no longer be accessible after the end of Version 3.8. You will also no longer be able to open treasure chests, gather materials, or earn quest rewards within the Veluriyam Mirage, so grab the opportunity to explore away!

◆ In Co-Op Mode, the areas within the Veluriyam Mirage that each Traveler has access to will depend on their progress in the game.

</details>
II. New Outfits

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Klee - "Blossoming Starlight"</span></summary>

◆ During Version 3.8, Travelers can obtain Kaeya's outfit "Sailwind Shadow" for free through the "Secret Summer Paradise" event.

◆ After Version 3.8 is over, Travelers can buy the outfit in the Character Outfit Shop.

- New Furnishing: "Leisure Device: Twang-Bang-Bang"

A combination device designed with great care by Tubby, using both the Scoreboard and Boom-Boom Barrels. By interacting with the Scoreboard, a timed shooting game will begin, or previous scores can be viewed. Before beginning the game, the locations of the Boom-Boom Barrels can be freely adjusted.

Though the Traveler is not an especially gifted archer, Tubby has heard that among the guests invited to The Realm Within, there are archers that can "pierce a pot from a hundred paces." Guests like this would surely like to practice their skills, and further hone their accuracy. And so, a mechanism that can be combined with all kinds of various furnishings to create unique and exciting challenges was born...

- "Genius Invokation TCG" Gameplay Update:

New Character Cards: Yanfei, Kaedehara Kazuha, and Candace, and their corresponding Talent cards.

New invitation duels and guest challenges added to the Player List.

New Action Cards: Fruit of Fulfillment, Master Zhang, Rhythm of the Great Dream, Ancient Courtyard, and Covenant of Rock.

Adds new Action Card type "Arcane Legend" and related rules:

(1) You can only have one of each identical Arcane Legend card in your deck.

(2) Your starting hand will contain an Arcane Legend card from your deck.

(3) Each player may only play one Arcane Legend card for the entire game.

- Spiral Abyss

Floor 11 Ley Line Disorder changed to:

• All party members receive a 75% Physical DMG Bonus.

Updated the monster lineup on Floor 11 of the Spiral Abyss.

Updated the monster lineup on Floor 12 of the Spiral Abyss.

Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 3.8, the three Lunar Phases will be as follows:

Phase I:

Fleeting Moon

Within 10s after the character enters the field, the character's Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks will deal 30% increased DMG. Their ATK SPD will also be increased by 10%. This effect will be canceled when the character leaves the field.

Phase II:

Shifting Moon

When a character loses or restores HP, all party members will gain 7.5% increased ATK for 10s. This effect can be triggered once every 0.1s. Max 4 stacks. Each stack will be counted independently.

Phase III:

Ingressing Moon

When the active character deals consecutive instances of Elemental DMG of the same Elemental Type or Physical DMG using Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attacks to an opponent, they will gain 1 count stack. 1 stack can be gained every 0.3s. The stacks for every Elemental and Physical DMG will be counted independently. After 6 stacks have been gained, a shockwave will be unleashed at the opponent's position, dealing True DMG and clearing all previously accumulated stacks for this DMG type. Should the active character leave the field, these stacks will be cleared.

Dear Travelers:

To ensure that all Travelers have the best-possible Genshin Impact experience, our developers continually make optimizations and bug fixes to the game based on Travelers' feedback.

〓Known Issues〓

- There is an issue in Genius Invokation TCG whereby when you have 0 Elemental Dice before the Action Phase begins, you would still be able to abnormally play the Event Card "Covenant of Rock" due to the Omni Element generated by the Equipment Card "Gambler's Earrings" after the Action Phase begins. (Under normal conditions, "Covenant of Rock" will not be playable as you have more than 0 Elemental Dice at this time.)  This issue will be fixed in a future version. Please stay tuned for future notices.

- There is an issue whereby when carrying out the World Quests "Capturing Light and Shadow" or "Returning Curios" in Co-Op Mode, the host is unable to obtain the Mora treasure chest related to the "Choo-Choo Cart" gameplay under specific circumstances. We will issue the treasure chest reward via an in-game mail to all affected Travelers after the end of Version 3.8.

- The World Quest "A Starry Night, as Remembered" is a limited-time quest, and cannot be accepted and completed after the end of Version 3.8. Travelers, please note the quest period.

- There is an issue in Genius Invokation TCG whereby when the Character Card "Eula" gains Grimheart, the DMG value indicated in the Elemental Skill description will be abnormally stated as "Deals 4 Cryo DMG" (the actual DMG dealt is as intended, and is 5 Cryo DMG). This issue will be fixed in a future version. Please stay tuned for future notices.

We urge Travelers to protect their personal property and information, ignore any requests for account sharing or trading, and refrain from purchasing accounts on other platforms. Likewise, Travelers are forbidden from sharing or selling their own account.

In accordance with Genshin Impact's Terms of Service, we will not be responsible for any personal information leaks or damages resulting from a Traveler's own actions.
