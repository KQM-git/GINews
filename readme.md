I. New Characters

<details open="true">
<summary><span style="color:rgba(204,144,70,1)"><span>5-Star Character "Helm of the Radiant Rose" Navia (Geo)</span></span></summary>

◇ Vision: Geo

◇ Weapon: Claymore

◇ The current President of Spina di Rosula, who is lovely, dutiful, and a great boss.

◆ Elemental Skill: Ceremonial Crystalshot

◆ When a character in a party with Navia obtains an Elemental Shard created from the Crystallize reaction, Navia will gain Crystal Shrapnel. When she fires, Navia will fire multiple Rosula Shardshots that can penetrate opponents, dealing Geo DMG. The more Rosula Shardshots that strike opponents, the greater the DMG dealt to them. Unleashing Navia's Elemental Skill will consume accumulated Crystal Shrapnel stacks, and the number of Rosula Shardshots and DMG dealt by "Ceremonial Crystalshot" will be increased based on the number of Crystal Shrapnel stacks. Hold the Elemental Skill to enter Aiming Mode and continually collect Elemental Shards nearby.

◆ Elemental Burst: As the Sunlit Sky's Singing Salute

◆ Call for a magnificent Rosula Dorata Salute. Unleashes a massive cannon bombardment on opponents in front of her, dealing AoE Geo DMG and providing Cannon Fire Support for a duration afterward, periodically dealing Geo DMG. When cannon attacks hit opponents, Navia will gain 1 stack of Crystal Shrapnel.

</details>

<details open="true">
<summary><span style="color:rgba(236,73,35,1)"><span>4-Star Character "Executor of Justice" Chevreuse (Pyro)</span></span></summary>

◇ Vision: Pyro

◇ Weapon: Polearm

◇ The captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, who wears justice as an ever-present seal upon her heart. Her musket shall only ever point at the guilty.

◆ Elemental Skill: Short-Range Rapid Interdiction Fire

◆ Fires at her opponent(s), dealing AoE Pyro DMG. If a nearby character in the party triggers an Overloaded reaction, Chevreuse gains 1 Overcharged Ball, increasing the AoE and DMG of her Elemental Skill. After Chevreuse fires a shot, she will continuously restore HP to the active character on the field.

◆ Elemental Burst: Ring of Bursting Grenades

◆ Fires an explosive grenade at opponents, dealing AoE Pyro DMG. After the projectile hits, it will split into many secondary explosive shells. These shells will burst after a short interval, dealing Pyro DMG.

</details>
II. New Equipment

1. New Weapons (Examples based on Refinement Rank 1)

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Verdict (5-Star Claymore)</span></summary>

Increases ATK by 20%. When characters in your party obtain Elemental Shards from Crystallize reactions, the equipping character will gain 1 Seal, increasing Elemental Skill DMG by 18%. The Seal lasts for 15s, and the equipper may have up to 2 Seals at once. All of the equipper's Seals will disappear 0.2s after their Elemental Skill deals DMG.

◆ During the event wish "Epitome Invocation," the event-exclusive 5-star weapon Verdict (Claymore) will receive a huge drop-rate boost!

</details>

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Ultimate Overlord's Mega Magic Sword (4-Star Claymore)</span></summary>

ATK increased by 12%. That's not all! The support from all Melusines you've helped in Merusea Village fills you with strength! Based on the number of them you've helped, your ATK is increased by up to an additional 12%.

</details>
2. New Artifacts

<details open="true">
<summary><span>Song of Days Past (4-Star and 5-Star)</span></summary>

◇ 2-Piece Set: Healing Bonus +15%.

◇ 4-Piece Set: When the equipping character heals a party member, the Yearning effect will be created for 6s, which records the total amount of healing provided (including overflow healing). When the duration expires, the Yearning effect will be transformed into the "Waves of Days Past" effect: When your active party member hits an opponent with a Normal Attack, Charged Attack, Plunging Attack, Elemental Skill, or Elemental Burst, the DMG dealt will be increased by 8% of the total healing amount recorded by the Yearning effect. The "Waves of Days Past" effect is removed after it has taken effect 5 times or after 10s. A single instance of the Yearning effect can record up to 15,000 healing, and only a single instance can exist at once, but it can record the healing from multiple equipping characters. Equipping characters on standby can still trigger this effect.

</details>

<details open="true">

To ensure a fair and healthy Genshin Impact gaming environment and offer Travelers a great gaming experience, we would like to remind everyone that the following rules apply to all Travelers at all times:

2) The sale, purchase, or transfer of accounts by any means is strictly forbidden.

We urge Travelers to protect their personal property and information, ignore any requests for account sharing or trading, and refrain from purchasing accounts on other platforms. Likewise, Travelers are forbidden from sharing or selling their own account.

In accordance with Genshin Impact's Terms of Service, we will not be responsible for any personal information leaks or damages resulting from a Traveler's own actions.
